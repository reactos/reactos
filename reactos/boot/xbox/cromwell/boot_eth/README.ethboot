"ethboot" is a Cromwell image that can be used to chainload Cromwell
via Etherboot. This makes it easy to test out new Cromwell builds 
without needing to burn them into flash memory.

"ethboot" can be used just like a kernel image, i.e. it needs to be copied to 
your tftp directory and specified in the "filename" option of dhcpd.conf. 
Select the Etherboot option in Cromwell and enjoy your new BIOS.
