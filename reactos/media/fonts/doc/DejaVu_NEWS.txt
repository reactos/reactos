Changes from 2.8 to 2.9:

- DejaVuSansExtraLight.sfd: changed family name from "DejaVu Sans" to
  "DejaVu Sans Light" (in case we add a Light weight variant), so legacy
  apps that understand only 4 styles are happy. (by Denis Jacquerye)
- added Name ID 16, aka preferred family name, and Name ID 17, aka
  preferred style name, so contemporary apps that understand more that 4
  styles can use big fonts families "DejaVu Sans" and "DejaVu Serif". For
  those, Extralight and Condensed are just styles not different families.
