        <para>
          The GNOME Documentation Project (GDP) aims to provide GNOME
          and GNOME applications with a complete, intuitive, and clear
          documentation system.  At the center of the GDP is the
          <application>GNOME Help Browser</application>, which
          presents a unified interface to GNOME-specific documentation
          as well as other Linux documentation such as man pages and
          texinfo documents. The GNOME Help System provides a
          comprehensive view of documentation on a machine by
          dynamically assembling the documentation of GNOME
          applications and components which are installed. The GDP is
          responsible for writing numerous GNOME-related documents,
          both for developers and for users.  Developer documentation
          includes <ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/"
          type="http">APIs for the GNOME libraries</ulink>, <ulink

       <title>Joining the GDP</title>
       <para>
         Documenting GNOME and all the numerous GNOME applications is
         a very large project.  The GDP is always looking for people
         to help write, update, and edit documentation.  If you are
         interested in joining the GDP team, you should join the
         <ulink url="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gnome-doc-list/">
         <citetitle>gnome-doc-list mailing list</citetitle> </ulink>.
         Read <xref linkend="gettingstarted" />, for help selecting a
         project to work on.  Feel free to introduce yourself on the
         gnome-doc-list mailing list and indicate which project you
         intend to work on, or else ask for suggestions of important
         documents which need work done. You may also want to join the
         #docs IRC channel on irc.gnome.org to meet other GDP members
         and discuss any questions you may have.  For a list of GDP
         projects and members, see the

       <para>
        GNOME developers, packagers, and translators may not be
        writing GNOME documentation but will want to understand how
        the GNOME documentation system works and will need to
        collaborate with GDP members.  This document should help to
        outline the structure of how the GNOME documentation system
        works.  Developers who do not write the documentation for
        their applications are encouraged to find a GDP member to
        write the documentation.  This is best done by sending an
        email to the <ulink
        url="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gnome-doc-list/">
        <citetitle>gnome-doc-list mailing list</citetitle> </ulink>
        describing the application, where it can be downloaded from,
        and that the developer(s) would like a GDP member to write
        documentation for the application. The #docs IRC channel on
        irc.gnome.org is another option for contacting GDP members.

      <title>About This Handbook</title>
      <para>
       This Handbook is a guide for both writing documentation for
       GNOME components and applications and for properly binding and
       packaging documentation into GNOME applications.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Handbook, like all GNOME documentation, was written in
       DocBook(SGML) and is available in several formats including
       SGML, HTML, PostScript, and PDF.  For the latest version, see

        <title>Document Something You Know</title>
        <para>
          The most frequently asked question of new contributors who
          join the GDP is "which document should I start
          with?". Because most people involved are volunteers, we do
          not <emphasis>assign</emphasis> projects and applications to
          write documents for. The first step is all yours - you must
          decide what about GNOME interests you most and find out if
          it has complete documents or not.
        </para>
        <para>
          It is also important to spend some time with GNOME to make
          sure you are familiar enough with it to be
          <emphasis>authoritative</emphasis>  in your writing. The
          best way to do this is to just sit down and play with GNOME
          as much as possible before starting to write.
        </para>
        <para>
          The easiest way to get started is to improve existing
          documentation. If you notice some inaccuracies or omissions
          in the documentation, or you think that you can explain the
          material more clearly, just send your suggestions to the
          author of the original documentation or to the GNOME
          documentation project at <email>docs@gnome.org</email>.

          web page which tracks the status of all the various
          documentation components of GNOME.  These components include
          application documentation, internal GNOME component
          documentation, user documentation, and developer
          documentation.  For each documentation item, it tracks the
          current status of the documentation, who is working on the
          particular document, where the documentation can be found,
          and provides a forum for the discussion of each item.

          you have selected an item to work on, please register
          yourself as an author so that other authors do not duplicate
          your work and may contact you to help or offer suggestions.
          Also be sure to keep the status icons up-to-date  so that
          the GDP team can easily identify which items need additional
          help.  The <citetitle>DocTable</citetitle> also allows
          people to make announcements and suggestions and to discuss

        All documentation for the GNOME project is written in SGML
        using the DocBook DTD. There are many advantages to using
        this for documentation, not least of which is the single
        source nature of SGML. To contribute to the GDP you should
        learn to use DocBook.

          Due to some license issues involved with the creation of
          gifs, the GNOME Documentation Project has decided to use the
          PNG image format for all images in GNOME documentation. You

          The current DocBook DTD(3.1) does not include support for

          many screenshots in its documentation, we use our own
          variation on the DocBook DTD which has PNG image support.
          We encourage everybody to use this DTD instead of the
          default DocBook DTD since your source document header and
          your output document appearance subtly vary between the two

        <title>Editors</title>
        <para>
          There are many editors on Linux and UNIX systems available
          to you. Which editor you use to work on the sgml documents
          is completely up to you, as long as the editor is able to
          preserve sgml and produce the source in a format that is
          readable by everyone.
        </para>
        <para>
          Probably the two most popular editors available are
          <application>Emacs</application> and
          <application>vi</application>. These and other editors are
          used regularly by members of the GDP. Emacs has a major
          mode, psgml, for editing sgml files which can save you time
          and effort in adding and closing tags. You will find the
          psgml package in DocBook Tools, which is the standard set of
          tools for the GDP. You may find out more about DocBook Tools
          in <xref linkend="installingdocbook" />.

        <title>Creating Something Useful with your Docs</title>
        <para>
          The tools available in DocBook Tools allow you to convert
          your sgml document to many different formats including html
          and Postscript. The primary tool used to do the conversion
          is an application called <application>Jade</application>. In
          most cases you will not have to work directly with
          <application>Jade</application>; Instead,  you will use the
          scripts provided by DocBook Tools.
        </para>
        <para>
          To preview your DocBook document, it is easiest to convert
          it to <filename>html</filename>. If you have installed the
          DocBook tools described above, all you have to do is to run
          the command <prompt>$</prompt><command>db2html
          mydocument.sgml</command>. If there are no sgml syntax
          errors, this will create a directory <filename
          class="directory">mydocument</filename> and place the
          resulting html files in it. The title page of the document
          will typically be
          <filename>mydocument/index.html</filename>.  If you have
          screenshots in your document, you will have to copy these
          files into the <filename
          class="directory">mydocument</filename> directory by
          hand. You can use any web browser to view your document.
          Note that every time you run <command>db2html</command>, it
          creates the <filename
          class="directory">mydocument</filename> directory over, so
          you will have to copy the screenshots over each time.
        </para>
        <para>
          You can also convert your document to PostScript by running
          the command <prompt>$</prompt><command>db2ps
          mydocument.sgml</command>, after which you can print out or
          view the resulting .ps file.

            The html files you get will not look quite the same as the
            documentation distributed with GNOME unless you have the
            custom stylesheets installed on your machine. DocBook
            Tools' default stylesheets will produce a different look
            to your docs. You can read more about the GDP stylesheets
            in <xref linkend="gdpstylesheets" />.

        <title>Images in DocBook Tools</title>
        <para>
          If your document uses images you will need to take note of a
          few things that should take place in order for you to make
          use of those images in your output.
        </para>
        <para>
          The DocBook Tools scripts and applications are smart enough
          to know that when you are creating html you will be using
          PNG files and when you are creating Postscript you will be
          using EPS files (you must use EPS with Postscript).
        </para>
        <para>
          Thus, you should never explicitly
          include the extension of the image file, since DocBook
          Tools will automatically insert it for you. For example:
        </para>
        <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
<figure>
 <title>My Image</title>
 <screenshot>
  <screeninfo>Sample GNOME Display</screeninfo>

  </graphic>
 </screenshot>
</figure>
]]>     </programlisting>
        <para>
          You will notice in this example that the file
          <filename>myfile.png</filename> was referred to as simply
          <filename>myfile</filename>. Now when you run
          <command>db2html</command> to create an html file, it will
          automatically look for <filename>myfile.png</filename> in
          the directory.
        </para>
        <para>
          If you want to create PostScript ouput, you will need to create an
          EPS version of your image file to be displayed in the
          PostScript file. There is a simple script available which
          allows you to change a PNG image into an EPS file
          easily. You can download this file - img2eps - from <ulink
          url="http://people.redhat.com/dcm/sgml.html"
          type="html">http://people.redhat.com/dcm/sgml.html</ulink>
          (look for the img2eps section).  Note that this script is
          included in the gnome-doc-tools package, so if you are using
          this package, you should already have
          <command>img2eps</command> on you system.

        applet, application, GNOME component, or widget being
        discussed.  As discussed above in <xref linkend="gdpdtd"/> you
        will need to install the special GDP DocBook DTD which
        supports PNG images, the format used for all images in GNOME
        documentation. For the basic DocBook structure used to insert
        images in a document, see <xref linkend="jadeimages"/> above.

      <sect3 id="screenshotappearance">
        <title>Screenshot Appearance</title>
        <para>
          For all screenshots of windows that typically have border
          decorations (e.g. applications and dialogs, but not applets
          in a <interface>panel</interface>), GDP standards dictate
          the appearance of the window.  (This is to minimize possible
          confusion to the reader, improve the appearance of GNOME
          documents, and guarantee the screenshot is readable when
          printed.) All screenshots should be taken with the SawFish
          (formerly known as Sawmill) window manager using the
          MicroGui theme and Helvetica 12pt font. (A different window
          manager can be used provided the MicroGui theme is available
          for this window manager and the appearance is identical to
          that when using the SawFish window manager.) The default
          GTK+ theme(gtk) and font (Helvetica 12 pt) should be used
          for all screenshots.  If you are unable to provide

          There are many tools for taking screenshots in
          GNOME/Linux. Perhaps the most convenient is the
          <application>Screen-Shooter Applet</application>. Just click
          on the window icon in the applet and then on the window you
          would like to take a screenshot of. (Note that
          at the time of this writing, PNG images taken by
          screenshooter do not appear properly in
          <application>Netscape</application> or the
          <application>GNOME Help Browser</application>.  You
          should save your screenshot as a GIF and
          then use <command>convert filename.gif
          filename.png</command>.) For applets
          in a <interface>Panel</interface>,
          <application>xv</application> can be used to crop the
          screenshot to only include the relevant portion of the
          <interface>Panel</interface>. Note that
          <application>xv</application> and 
          <application>gimp</application> can both be used for taking

          Screenshots should be kept in the main documentation
          directory with your SGML file for applets, or should be
          kept in a directory called "figs" for application and other
          documentation.  After you use <command>db2html</command> to
          convert your SGML file to HTML (see <xref
          linkend="make-output"/>), you will need to copy your
          screenshots (either the individual PNG files for applet
          documentation, or the whole "figs" directory for other
          documentation) into the newly created HTML directory.  Note
          that every time you use <command>db2html</command> the HTML
          directory is erased and rewritten, so do not store your only
          copy of the screenshots in that directory.  If you wish to
          create PostScript or PDF output, you will need to manually
          convert the PNG images to EPS as described in <xref
          linkend="jadeimages"/>, but will not need to copy these

    <sect2 id="applicationbugs">
      <title>Application Bugs</title>
      <para>
        Documentation authors tend to investigate and test applets and
        applications more thoroughly than most 
        users.  Often documentation authors will discover one or
        more bugs in the software.  These bugs vary from small ones,
        such as mis-spelled words or missing
        <interface>About</interface> dialogs in the menu, to large
        ones which cause the applet to crash.  As all users, you
        should be sure to report these bugs so that application
        developers know of them and can fix them.  The easiest way to
        submit a bug report is by using the <application>Bug
        Buddy</application> applet which is part of the gnome-applets
        package.

    <sect2 id="cvs">
      <title>Using CVS</title>
      <para>
        CVS (Concurrent Versions System) is a tool that allows
        multiple developers to concurrently work on a set of
        documents, keeping track of the modifications made by each
        person.  The files are stored on a server and each developer
        checks files out, modifies them, and then checks in their
        modified version of the files.  Many GNOME programs and
        documents are stored in CVS.  The GNOME CVS server allows
        users to anonymously check out CVS files. Most GDP members
        will need to use anonymous CVS to download the most up-to-date
        version of documentation or programs.  Modified documents will
        typically be emailed to the the application developer. Core
        GDP members may also be granted login CVS privileges so they
        may commit modified files directly to CVS.
      </para>

      <sect3 id="anonymouscvs">
        <title>Anonymous CVS</title>
        <para>
          To anonymously check out documents from CVS, you must first
          log in.  From the bash shell, you should set your CVSROOT
          shell variable with <command>  export
          CVSROOT=':pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome'</command>
          and then login with <command>cvs login</command>(there is no
          password, just hit return). As an example, we will use the
          "gnome-docu/gdp" module which contains this and several
          other documents. To check these documents out for the first
          time, type <command>cvs -z3 checkout

          Because files in CVS are typically used and modified by
          multiple developers and documentation authors, users should
          exercise a few simple practices out of courtesy towards the
          other CVS users and the project leader.  First, you should
          not make CVS commits to a package without first discussing
          your plans with the project leader.  This way, the project
          leader knows who is modifying the files and generally, what
          sort of changes/development is being done.  Also, whenever a
          CVS user commits a file to CVS, they should make an entry in
          the CVS log and in the <filename>ChangeLog</filename> so
          that other users know who is making modifications and what
          is being modified.  When modifying files created by others,
          you should follow the indentation scheme used by the initial
          author.

<!-- ####### DocBook Basics | Introduction to DocBook ####### -->

    <sect2 id="introtodocbook">
      <title>Introduction to DocBook</title>
      <para>
        To understand DocBook, a basic understanding of SGML is
        helpful. SGML stands for Standard General Markup Language and
        is one of the first markup languages every created. HTML is
        actually derived from SGML and XML is a subset of SGML.  SGML
        uses what is called a Document Type Definition to specify
        <emphasis>elements</emphasis> which are contained between
        brackets, &lt; and >. Text is marked by both beginning and
        ending elements, for example in the DocBook DTD, one denotes a
        title with <sgmltag>&lt;title></sgmltag>The
        Title<sgmltag>&lt;/title></sgmltag>.
      </para>
      <para>
        The DTD (in the case of the GDP, DocBook) defines rules for how the
        elements can be used. For example, if one element can only be used when
        embedded within another, this is defined in the DTD.
      </para>
      <para> 
	An SGML file is just a plain ASCII file containing the text
	with the markup specified above. To convert it  to some easily
	readable format, you need special tools. The GDP uses <emphasis>DocBook
        Tools</emphasis>, a free package of utilities for working with DocBook
        which includes <emphasis>Jade</emphasis>, which does the SGML/DSSL
        parsing. You can read more about DocBook Tools in <xref
        linkend="installingdocbook" />. 
      </para>
      <para>
        The final appearance of the output (e.g. PostScript or HTML)
        is determined by a
        <emphasis>stylesheet</emphasis>. Stylesheets are files,
        written in a special language (DSSSL &mdash; Document Style
        Semantics and Specification Language), which  specify the
        appearance of various DocBook elements, for example,
        what fonts to use for titles and various inline elements, page
        numbering style, and much more. DocBook tools come with a
        collection of stylesheets (Norman Walsh's modular
        stylesheets); GNOME Document Project uses some customized
        version of this stylesheets &mdash; see <xref
        linkend="gdpstylesheets"/>.   
      </para>
      <para>
        The advantage of specifying the <emphasis>structure</emphasis>
        of a document with SGML instead of specifying the
        <emphasis>appearance</emphasis> of the document with a typical
        word processor, or with html, is that the resulting document
        can be processed in a variety of ways using the structural
        information.  Whereas formatting a document for appearance
        assumes a medium (typically written text on a standard-sized
        piece of paper), SGML can be processed to produce output for a
        large variety of media such as text, postscript, HTML,
        Braille, audio, and potentially many other formats.
      </para>
      <para>
        Using 'content' as the elements to define the text of a document also
        allows for search engines to make use of the actual elements to make a
        "smarter search". For example, if you are searching for all documents
        written by the author "Susie" your search engine could be made smart
        enough to only search &lt;author> elements, making for a faster and more
        accurate search.
      </para>
      <para>
        Since the overall appearance of the output is determined not by the DTD
        or the SGML document, but rather by a stylesheet, the appearance of a
        document can be easily changed just by changing the stylesheet. This
        allows everyone in the project to create documents that all look the
        same.
      </para>
      <para>
        As stated before, the GDP uses the DocBook DTD.  For a list of
        introductory and reference resources on DocBook, see <xref
        linkend="resources" />.  The following sections also provide
        convenient instructions on which markup tags to use in various
        circumstances.  Be sure to read <xref linkend="conventions" />
        for GDP documentation-specific guidelines.

 <!-- ######  DocBook Basics | XML and SGML       ########--> 
 <sect2 id="xml">
      <title>XML and SGML</title>

      <para> In not so distant future (probably before GNOME 2.0),
      DocBook itself and GNOME Documentation project will migrate from
      SGML to XML. This transition should be relatively painless:
      (almost) all DocBook tags will remain the same. However, XML has
      stricter syntax rules than SGML; thus, some constructions which
      are valid in SGML will not be valid in XML. Therefore, to be
      ready for this transistion, it is <emphasis>strongly
      advised</emphasis> that the documentation writers conform to XML
      syntax rules. Here are most important differences:
      </para>
	
      <variablelist>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term> <emphasis>Minimization</emphasis></term> 
	    <listitem>
	    
	    <para>
	      It is possible with some implementations of SGML to use
	      minimizations to close elements in a document by using
	      &lt;/>, for example:
	      <literal><sgmltag>&lt;title></sgmltag>The
		Title<sgmltag>&lt;/></sgmltag></literal>. This is not
              allowed in XML. You can use <command>sgmlnorm</command> command,
              included in DocBook Tools package, to expand minimized tags;
              if you are using <application>Emacs</application> with psgml
              mode, you can also use menu command
          <menuchoice>
             <guimenu>Modify</guimenu>
             <guimenuitem>Normalize</guimenuitem>

	    <term> <emphasis>Self-closing tags</emphasis></term> 
	    <listitem>
 
         <para>
            Also, in SGML some tags are allowed not to have closing
            tags.  For example, it is legal for
            <sgmltag>&lt;xref></sgmltag> not to have a closing tag: 
            <literal><sgmltag>&lt;xref 
                   linkend="someid"></sgmltag></literal>. In
            XML, it is illegal; instead, you should use  
            <literal><sgmltag>&lt;xref 
                   linkend="someid"/></sgmltag></literal> (note the
            slash!).
          </para> 
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	    <term> <emphasis>Case sensitive tags</emphasis></term> 
	    <listitem>
	    <para>
	      In XML, unlike SGML, tags are case-senstive
	      <sgmltag>&lt;title></sgmltag> and
	      <sgmltag>&lt;TITLE></sgmltag> are different tags!
	      Therefore, please always use lowercase tags (except for
	      things like <literal>DOCTYPE, CDATA</literal> and
	      <literal>ENTITY</literal>, which are not DocBook tags).

              for long dash (see <xref linkend="specsymb" />). Also,
              please note that the result looks much nicer because the

	    than itemizedlists, but for larger blocks of text, or when
	    you're explaining or defining something, it's best to use
	    them.  Their greatest advantage is that it's easier for a
	    computer to search.  The lines you are reading now were
	    produced by <sgmltag>&lt;variablelist></sgmltag>. The

          To refer to another place in the same document, you can use
          tags <sgmltag>&lt;xref></sgmltag> and
          <sgmltag>&lt;link></sgmltag>. The first of them
          automatically inserts the full name of the element you refer
          to (section, figure, etc.), while the second just creates a
          link (in HTML output). Here is an example:
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[An example of a <link linkend="extip">tip</link> was given in
<xref linkend="notes" />.  ]]>
          </programlisting>

        <para>
          Here <sgmltag>notes</sgmltag> and <sgmltag>extip</sgmltag>
          are the id attributes of <xref linkend="notes" /> and of the
          example of a tip in it.
        </para>
        <para>  To produce a link  to an external source, such as a
          Web page or a local file, use <sgmltag>&lt;ulink></sgmltag>
          tag, for example:
          <programlisting>

        <sgmltag>&lt;userinput></sgmltag>.
        </para>
        <para>  To mark keystrokes such as shortcuts and other
          commands, use <sgmltag>&lt;keycap></sgmltag>. 
          This is used for marking up what is printed on the top 
          of the physical key on the keyboard. There are a couple of
          other tags for keys, too: <sgmltag>&lt;keysym&gt;</sgmltag>
          and <sgmltag>&lt;keycode&gt;</sgmltag>. However you are
          unlikely to need these for most documentation. For reference,
          <sgmltag>&lt;keysym&gt;</sgmltag> is for the <quote>symbolic
          name</quote> of a key. <sgmltag>&lt;keycode&gt;</sgmltag> is
          for the <quote>scan code</quote> of a key. These are not
          terms commonly required in <acronym>GNOME</acronym> documentation,
          although <sgmltag>&lt;keysym&gt;</sgmltag> is useful for marking
          up control codes.
       </para>
       <para>
          To mark up a combination of keystrokes, use the
          <sgmltag>&lt;keycombo></sgmltag> wrapper:
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
<keycombo>
 <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
 <keycap>Alt</keycap>
 <keycap>F1</keycap>
</keycombo>]]>
          </programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>
          Finally, if you want to show a shortcut for some menu
          command, here are the appropriate tags (rather long):
          <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
<menuchoice>
 <shortcut>
  <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>q</keycap></keycombo>
 </shortcut> 
 <guimenuitem> Quit</guimenuitem> 
</menuchoice>]]>
          </programlisting>
          which produces simply
          <menuchoice>
            <shortcut>   <keysym>Ctrl-q</keysym> </shortcut>
            <guimenuitem> Quit</guimenuitem>

       Every GNOME application or applet should have a manual specific

      and authoritative guide.  The manual should describe what the
      program does and how to use it.  Manuals will typically describe

    <title>Listing Documents in the Help Menu</title>

    <note>
      <title>Developer Information</title>
      <para>
        This section is for developers.  Documentation authors
        generally do not need to know this material.
      </para>
    </note>
    <para>
      Typically the application manual and possibly additional help
      documents will be made available to the user under the
      <guimenu>Help</guimenu> menu at the top right of the
      application. To do this, you must first write a
      <filename>topic.dat</filename> file. The format for this file is:
      <programlisting>
One line for each 'topic'.

Two columns, as defined by perl -e 'split(/\s+/,$aline,2)'

First column is the HTML file (and optional section) for the topic,
relative to the app's help file dir.

Second column is the user-visible topic name.
      </programlisting>
      For example, <application>Gnumeric</application>'s
      <filename>topic.dat</filename> file is:
      <programlisting>
gnumeric.html   Gnumeric manual
function-reference.html Gnumeric function reference
      </programlisting>
      When the application is installed, the
      <filename>topic.dat</filename> file should be placed in the
      <filename
      class="directory">$prefix/share/gnome/help/<replaceable>appname</replaceable>/C/</filename> directory
      where <replaceable>appname</replaceable> is replaced by the
      application's name.  The application documentation (converted
      from SGML into HTML with <command>db2html</command>) should be
      placed in this directory too.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
       If the help files are not present in the correct directory, the
       menu items will NOT appear when the program is run. 
      </para>
    </note>
    <para>
      The <filename>topic.dat</filename> file is used by the GNOME
      menu building code to generate the <guimenu>Help</guimenu>
      menu. When you define your menu:  
<programlisting>
GnomeUIInfo helpmenu[] = {
              {GNOME_APP_UI_ITEM, 
               N_("About"), N_("Info about this program"),
               about_cb, NULL, NULL, 
               GNOME_APP_PIXMAP_STOCK, GNOME_STOCK_MENU_ABOUT,
               0, 0, NULL},
               GNOMEUIINFO_SEPARATOR,
               GNOMEUIINFO_HELP("<emphasis>appname</emphasis>"),
               GNOMEUIINFO_END
        };
</programlisting>
      the line specifying <varname>GNOMEUIINFO_HELP</varname> causes
      GNOME to create a menu entry which is tied to the documentation
      in the directory mentioned above. Also, all the topics in the
      <filename>topic.dat</filename> file will get menu entries in the
      <guimenu>Help</guimenu> menu. When the user selects any of these
      topics from the <guimenu>Help</guimenu> menu, a help browser
      will be started with the associated HTML documentation.

        generally do not need to know this material.
      </para>
    </note>
    <para>
      Most GNOME applications will have <guibutton>Help</guibutton>
      buttons.  These are most often seen in Preference windows. (All
      Preference windows should have <guibutton>Help</guibutton>
      buttons.) Most <guibutton>Help</guibutton> buttons will connect
      to the application manual, although some may connect to special
      documents.  Because the <guibutton>Help</guibutton> buttons do
      not generally have their own special documentation, the
      documentation author(s) do not need to do very much.  However,
      the application author must be careful to guarantee that the
      application correctly opens the help documentation when the
      <guibutton>Help</guibutton> buttons are pressed.  
    </para>
    <para>
      To make the Help buttons call the correct document in the GNOME Help
      Browser the developer should add code based on the following example:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
gchar *tmp;
tmp = gnome_help_file_find_file ("module", "page.html");
if (tmp) {
  gnome_help_goto(0, tmp);
  g_free(tmp);
}
    </programlisting>

        In GNOME 2.0 each applet will have its own documentation
        installed separately, and the GNOME 2.0 help
        browser (<application>Nautilus</application>) will dynamically
        merge the applet documents into a single virtual book
        called <citetitle>GNOME Applets</citetitle>. During the
        transitionary stage between GNOME 1.0 and GNOME 2.0, each
        applet in the gnome-applets package has its own manual(stored
        with the applet in CVS), but they are merged together manually
        to create the <citetitle>GNOME Applets</citetitle> book before
        distribution.  Telsa 
        <email>hobbit@aloss.ukuu.org.uk</email> is the maintainer of
        this document.  Applet documentation should be sent to Telsa
        (or placed in CVS) who will make sure they are correctly
        packaged with the applets.  The applet author should be
        contacted to modify the menu items and help buttons to bind to
        the applet documentation if necessary.
      </para>
      <para>
        Images which are part of the applet documentation should be in
        PNG format and should reside in the same directory as the SGML

      </para>
      <para>
        Applets which are not part of the gnome-applets package must
        package their documentation with the particular applet
        package. They should use the same applet template as other

      Context sensitive help, also known as "pop-up" help, will allow
      a user to obtain help information about specific buttons or
      parts of an application.
    </para>
    <para>
      Context sensitive help is still under development and not all
      the details are available at this time. However, the basics can
      be shown here so that you can understand how the system will
      work.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Context Sensitive Help system is designed to allow the
      developer to give an id to a particular portion of the User
      Interface, for example, a button. Once the interface is complete
      a Perl script can then be run against the interface code to
      create a "map" file. This map file allows the developer or
      writer to associate particular paragraph sections from an XML
      document to the interface items.
    </para>
    <para>
      The XML used for the document is a small XML DTD that is being
      developed to use the same tags (albeit, much fewer) as DocBook
      so that writers do not have to re-learn a new DTD.
    </para>
    <para>
      Once the document is written and map file is complete, when the
      user launches context sensitive help on the interface (either by
      pressing a button and then clicking on the interface item they
      want information on, or by right mouse clicking on the interface
      item and selecting a pop-up menu item like "What's This") a
      small transient window will appear with brief but detailed

    <para>
       Most people have never enjoyed reading a software manual, and
       they probably never will.  Many times, they'll read the
       documentation only when they run into problems, and they'll be
       frustrated and upset before they even read a word.  On the
       other hand, some readers will read the manual all the way
       through, or at least look at the introduction before they
       start. Your document might serve as a reference for an expert
       or a guide to a beginner, and it must have enough depth to
       satisfy the first without overwhelming the second.  Ideally, it
       will serve beginners as they <emphasis>become</emphasis>
       experts. Remember, your goal is to produce <emphasis>complete,
       intuitive and clear</emphasis> documentation.
    </para>
    <para>
       In order to write useful documentation, you'll have to know who
       your audience is likely to be.  Then, you can look for the
       problems they're likely to run into, and solve them.  It will
       also help if you focus on the tasks users will perform, and
       group features accordingly, rather than simply describing
       features at random.

              Documents should be complete, yet concise.  You should
              describe every feature, but you'll have decide how much
              detail is really necessary.  It's not, for example,
              necessary to describe every button and form field in a
              dialog box, but you should make sure that your readers
              know how to bring up the dialog and what it does.  If
              you spend fewer words on the obvious, you can spend more
              time clarifying the ambiguous labels and explaining
              items that are more complex.

              It's good to provide a screenshot of any dialog windows
              a user might run into, but if a dialog box has several

      <title>Structure</title>
      <para>
         In general, you won't have to worry too much about structure,
         because the templates provide you with an excellent example.
         As a general rule, try to follow that structural example.
         That means using links, hierarchical nesting, and, if
         necessary, a glossary or index.  You probably won't need to
         use every available structural tag, but take advantage of
         what DocBook provides you.
      </para>
      <para>
         As to linking, there's some disagreement about whether to use
         <sgmltag>&lt;xref></sgmltag> <sgmltag>&lt;link></sgmltag>
         when you make links within your documents.  You'll have to
         decide, based on the different ways that they are presented
         in output, which is more appropriate given the context.
         Regardless of which you use, you should not forget to use
         them.  Help your readers find information that relevant to
         the issue at hand.
      </para>
      <para>
         The table of contents will be generated automatically, but
         you will probably have to develop your own index if you wish
         to have one.  The Nautilus Help Browser will have new, and
         currently unknown, indexing capabilities, so index style and
         structure are still under discussion.  The GNOME User's Guide
         will contain a glossary in its next versions; unless you're
         writing a<sgmltag>&lt;book></sgmltag>, it will probably be best to
         contribute to that rather than developing your own.

      <title>Grammar and Spelling</title>
      <para>
        Nobody expects you to be perfect; they just expect the
        documentation for their software to be error-free.  That means
        that, in the same way that developers look for bugs and accept
        bug reports, writers must check for errors in their documents.
        Poor grammar, bad spelling, and gross technical errors in
        draft documents are fine.  However, if those problems show up
        in a "real" release, they can count against the credibility of
        GNOME and Linux.  They'll also make you look bad.
      </para>
      <para>
        There is no substitute for a human proofreader; use a
        spell-check program, then read it over yourself, and then find
        someone else to help you.  Other GDP members are, of course,
        willing and able to help you, but non-writers are often at
        least as helpful.
      </para>
      <para>
        Proofreading documents is both a also a good way to
        familiarize yourself with documentation, and it certainly
        makes you valuable to the GDP. Help other writers proof their
        documents, and they will help you with yours.

        The GDP team is a valuable resource for any documentation
        author.  GDP members can answer most questions documentation
        authors have during the course of their work. It is also
        important to make sure you are not duplicating work of other
        GDP members by visiting the <citetitle>GDP Documentation
        Status Table</citetitle> (<ulink

        assigning a documentation item to yourself.  This table also
        provides a forum for making suggestions and announcements for
        each documentation item.  The best way to get in touch with
        GDP members is on the #docs IRC channel at irc.gnome.org or
        else by emailing the <ulink type="http"

        After an author has finished a document (or even a draft
        version of the document), it is a good idea to ask a member of
        the GDP team to read the document, checking it for grammar,
        proper DocBook markup, and clarity.  One may typically find
        another author to do this by either asking on the #docs IRC
        channel at irc.gnome.org or by emailing the <ulink type="http"

        Writing documentation typically involves a certain amount of
        interaction with the developers of GNOME or the application
        which is being documented.  Often a document author will need
        to ask the developer technical questions during the course of
        writing a document. After the document is finished, it is good
        idea to ask the developer to read the document to make sure it
        is technically correct.  The documentation author should also
        make sure that the application author correctly binds and
        packages the documentation with the application.

        When the document is finished, the document should be edited

        document to the application or package developer.  In some
        cases, the documents can be committed directly into CVS,
        however this should only be done after obtaining permission to
        make CVS commits from the developer.  Note that in many cases,
        the application may need to be modified to correctly link to
        the documentation.  The packaging system (tarballs and binary
        packages) may also need to be modified to include the
        documentation in the package.  Generally, this should be done
        by the developers.

	  <para>
            <application>MY-GNOME-APP</application> cannot prove
            incorrect theorems. If the theorem you have entered is not
            demonstrably true, you will get a message to that effect
            in the main window.  To disprove a theorem, ask
            <application>MY-GNOME-APP</application> to prove its
            logical inverse.

          Once you have proven the theorem, it will be displayed in
          the <interface>main window</interface>.  There, you can read
          it over, choose text styles for different portions of it,
          and make comments on it. This section will guide you through
          that process.
        </para>
	<para>
          To alter text styles, first select the statement you wish to
          change by clicking on it once.  You can select several
          statements by Then, choose the style you want to apply from
          the <guisubmenu>Style</guisubmenu> submenu of the
          <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu.
          <application>MY-GNOME-APP</application> will convert the
          text to that style.

        <para>
          You can also enter comments on a statement by selecting that

  <title>Introduction</title> 

  <!-- #### Intro | What Are Applets? ###### -->
  <sect1 id="applets-what-are">
   <title>What Are Applets?</title> 
   <para>
    Applets are one of the most popular and useful objects you can add
    to your <interface>Panel</interface> to customize your desktop.
    An applet is a small application which runs inside a small area of
    your <interface>Panel</interface>. Applets have been written for
    a wide range of purposes.  Some are very powerful interactive
    tools, such as the <application>Tasklist</application> Applet
    which allows you to easily 
    control all of your main applications.  Others are simple system
    monitors, displaying information such as the amount of power left
    in the battery on your laptop (see <application>Battery Charge
    Monitor</application>) or weather
    information(see <application>GNOME Weather</application>).  Some
    are simply for amusement(see <application>Fish</application>).
   </para>

   <para>
    Applets are similar to swallowed applications in that both of them
    reside within the <interface>Panel</interface>. However, 
    swallowed applications are generally applications which were
    not designed to run within the <interface>Panel</interface>.
    Typically one will swallow an application which already exists in
    the main <interface>desktop</interface> area, putting it into your
    <interface>Panel</interface>.  The application will continue to
    run in the <interface>Panel</interface> until you end the
    application or  unswallow it,  placing it back onto the main part of
    your desktop when you need to.

    Several example applets are shown in <xref
    linkend="example-applets-fig">.  From left to right, they are: (1)
    <application>Mixer Applet</application>, which allows you to turn
    on/off sound and control its volume by clicking on the applet.  (2)
    <application>Sound Monitor</application> Applet, which displays
    the current volume of sound being played and allows you to control
    various sound features.  (3) <application>GTCD</application>
    Applet, a CD player which has all its controls
    available in the applet and displays the track and time. (4)
    <application>Drive Mount</application> Applet, used to mount and
    unmount drives with a single click of the mouse. (5)
    <application>Desk Guide</application> which allows you to view
    and control multiple virtual screens. (6)
    <application>Tasklist</application> Applet which allows you to
    control your various windows and applications.
   </para>
   <para>
    There are many other applets to choose from.  The rest of this
    chapter will explain the basic information to get you started
    adding, moving, and removing applets from your
    <interface>Panels</interface> and using them. The following
    chapters go through each of the standard GNOME applets describing
    them in detail.  There are also additional applets which can be
    downloaded off the Web.   See <ulink type="http"
     url="http://www.gnome.org/applist/list-martin.phtml">The GNOME
    Software Map</ulink> for lists of additional GNOME applications
    and applets. 
   </para>
   <para>
    As you read through the the rest of this chapter, you should try
    adding and removing applets from your <interface>Panel</interface> and
    experiment with them freely.

     <menuchoice><guimenu>Panel</guimenu><guisubmenu>Add to panel</guisubmenu>
     <guisubmenu>Applet</guisubmenu></menuchoice>. This will show you
     the menu of all the applets on your system, divided into
     categories. Choosing any applet from this menu will add it to the
     <interface>Panel</interface>.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="moving-applets">
    <title>Moving Applets In or Between Panels</title>
    <para>
     It is easy to move applets in a <interface>Panel</interface> or
     between two <interface>Panels</interface>. If you have a
     three-button mouse, just move the mouse over the applet, depress
     the middle mouse button and drag the applet to its new location,
     releasing the middle mouse button when you are finished.  Note
     that you can drag applets within a <interface>Panel</interface>
     or between two <interface>Panels</interface> this way. If you
     don't have a three-button mouse, just 
     right-click on the applet and choose
     <guimenuitem>Move</guimenuitem>. The cursor will turn into a
     cross and the applet will move with your mouse until you press
     any mouse button to indicate you are finished moving it.
     If, in the course of this movement, it hits
     other objects, the behavior depends on the global preferences
     you have set for your <interface>Panels</interface> in the
     <application>GNOME Control Center</application>: the applet you are
     moving can switch places with other objects, "push" all objects
     it meets, or "jump" over all other objects without disturbing
     them. You can also override the default behavior by holding
     <keycap>Shift</keycap> button (for "push" mode),
     <keycap>Ctrl</keycap> (for "switched" mode), or
     <keycap>Alt</keycap> (for "free" mode, i.e. jumping other other
     objects without disturbing them) button while dragging.

     or <interface>Panel</interface> and select 
     <menuchoice>

      <guimenuitem>Global Preferences...</guimenuitem>

   <para>
    Clicking the right mouse button on any applet brings up
    a <guimenu>pop-up menu</guimenu>. This

         will move with it.  When you have finished moving the applet,
         click any mouse button and the applet will anchor in its

    <title>Other Common Pop-Up Items</title>
    <para>
     Many applets also have one or more of the following items in their
     right-click pop-up menu:
     <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
       <term>Run...</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         The <guimenuitem>Run...</guimenuitem> menu item generally
         invokes a program  which is related to the applet in some way
         but which runs in its own window rather than in the
         panel. For example: 
        </para>
        <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
          <para>
           The <application>CPU Load</application> applet, which monitors
           what programs are running, has a <guimenuitem>Run
           gtop...</guimenuitem>  menu item. Selecting this menu item
           starts <application>GTop</application>, which allows you to
           view and control programs which are running.
          </para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
          <para>
           The <application>CD Player</application> applet has a
           <guimenuitem>Run gtcd...</guimenuitem> menu item which
           starts the GNOME <application>CD Player</application> when
           selected, which has more capabilities than the applet.
