             TODO for the libxml2 Python wrappers

         $Id: TODO,v 1.8 2002/02/06 16:06:57 veillard Exp $

Things to do:
-------------

- SAX interfaces
  - push is done but no generic interface
  - elementDecl need some work
  - need more testing and check full callbacks for xmllib/sgmlop replacement
- enums -> libxml.py
- access to XPath variables
- xmlBuffer exposure
- xpathContext, being able to set/get info and clean it up
- more work needed on context handling for function lookup
  and use of an hash table.
- add regression tests
   - SAX flow
- DTD element and attributes content accesses
   - attribute handled in SAX
   - element needed in both


Done:
-----
- class hierarchy:
  + make specific node type inherit from xmlNode
    done, had to sort the classes in the output
  + get the generator to output a classes.txt description
    done libxml2class.txt
- add regression tests
   - tests/Makefile.am: export the Python class path
   - xpath queries
   - xpath extension
   - check memory
   - build tree
   - saving
- extensions based on a python.xml description of the new specific
  interfaces
   file libxml2-python-api.xml , first entry is xmlRegisterXPathFunction
- spec file: automatically generate for pythonX.Y if found
  Done, a bit ugly by running new makes in %install for each level
  found.
- error redirections and preformat
- handling of node.content
- access to xmlParserCtxt and push mode
   - needed for SAX too
   - entry points
   - wrappers
   - decent interface for setting/getting behaviour
- memory debug interfaces
- SAX interfaces
   - basic stuff with push is available
   - basic xmllib replacement
