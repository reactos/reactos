  Special notes to Unix users
  ===========================

  Please  read  the file  "docs/UPGRADE.UNX".   It contains  important
  information regarding the installation  of FreeType on Unix systems,
  especially GNU based operating systems like GNU/Linux.

  FreeType 2's  library is called `libfreetype',  FreeType 1's library
  is called `libttf'.  They are *not* compatible!


  FreeType 2.1.9
  ==============

  Please read the docs/CHANGES file, it contains IMPORTANT INFORMATION.

  Read the files "docs/INSTALL" for installation instructions.

  Note  that  the FreeType  2  documentation  is  now available  as  a
  separate package from our sites.  See:

    ftp://ftp.freetype.org/freetype/freetype2/ftdocs-2.1.9.tar.bz2
    ftp://ftp.freetype.org/freetype/freetype2/ftdocs-2.1.9.tar.gz
    ftp://ftp.freetype.org/freetype/freetype2/ftdoc219.zip


  Bugs
  ====

  Please report bugs by  e-mail to `devel@freetype.org'.  Don't forget
  to send  a detailed explanation of  the problem --  there is nothing
  worse  than receiving  a terse  message that  only says  "it doesn't
  work".


  Enjoy!
