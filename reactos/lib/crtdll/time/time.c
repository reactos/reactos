    /* NOTES:

       CONSTANTS: 
       The time difference between 1 January 1601, 00:00:00 and
       1 January 1970, 00:00:00 is 369 years, plus the leap years
       from 1604 to 1968, excluding 1700, 1800, 1900.
       This makes (1968 - 1600) / 4 - 3 = 89 leap days, and a total
       of 134774 days.

       Any day in that period had 24 * 60 * 60 = 86400 seconds.

       The time difference is 134774 * 86400 * 10000000, which can be written
       116444736000000000
       27111902 * 2^32 + 3577643008
       413 * 2^48 + 45534 * 2^32 + 54590 * 2^16 + 32768

       If you find that these constants are buggy, please change them in all
       instances in both conversion functions.

       VERSIONS:
       There are two versions, one of them uses long long variables and
       is presumably faster but not ISO C. The other one uses standard C
       data types and operations but relies on the assumption that negative
       numbers are stored as 2's complement (-1 is 0xffff....). If this
       assumption is violated, dates before 1970 will not convert correctly.
       This should however work on any reasonable architecture where WINE
       will run.

       DETAILS:
       
       Take care not to remove the casts. I have tested these functions
       (in both versions) for a lot of numbers. I would be interested in
       results on other compilers than GCC.

       The operations have been designed to account for the possibility
       of 64-bit time_t in future UNICES. Even the versions without
       internal long long numbers will work if time_t only is 64 bit.
       A 32-bit shift, which was necessary for that operation, turned out
       not to work correctly in GCC, besides giving the warning. So I
       used a double 16-bit shift instead. Numbers are in the ISO version
       represented by three limbs, the most significant with 32 bit, the
       other two with 16 bit each.

       As the modulo-operator % is not well-defined for negative numbers,
       negative divisors have been avoided in DOSFS_FileTimeToUnixTime.

       There might be quicker ways to do this in C. Certainly so in
       assembler.
