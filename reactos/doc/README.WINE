# ReactOS WINE porting guide for 0.3
# Update this file when you port a dll/program from WINE.

The ReactOS Project shares quite a bit of code with the WINE project.
This document should provide a compleate reference for all of the
locations in the ReactOS source tree where code is shared between the
two projects. If you find something is missing from this documentation
please add it.

If you find that a function in ReactOS that is not implemented properly
and is based on WINE sources, check the latest Winehq CVS and see if
it has been fixed there. If so, please submit a patch to 
ros-dev@reactos.com. Otherwise please send a patch to both 
wine-patches@winehq.com and ros-dev@reactos.com

When porting a dll from WINE to ReactOS please take a look at how
comctl32 has been imported. We start by creating a makefile that has
a target defined like so:

TARGET_TYPE = winedll

This will cause the reactos build system to look for a file called
makefile.ros-template. This file contains all of the information needed
for the ReactOS build system to make use of the WINE Makefile.in. 
This will allow you to use the WINE tools and librarys with very little
work to import a new dll.

The following build tools are shared with Wine.
reactos/tools/unicode		# Synced to Wine-20050419
reactos/tools/wpp		# Synced to Wine-20050419

In addition the following libs, dlls and source files are mostly based on code ported
from Winehq CVS. If you are looking to update something in these files
check Wine current souces first as it may already be fixed.

- Cd to the parent directory of your top-level "reactos" directory
- Check out the Wine release: "cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.winehq.com:2401/home/wine co wine -r Wine-20050211"
- Create "vendor" directory (as a sibling of your top-level "reactos" directory)
- Cd to the vendor dir and check out the current vendor drop:
  "svn co svn://svn.reactos.com/vendor/wine".
- For each component shared with Wine (e.g. cabinet):
  "del vendor\wine\dlls\cabinet\current\*"
  "copy wine\dlls\cabinet vendor\wine\dlls\cabinet\current"
  "del vendor\wine\dlls\cabinet\current\.cvsignore"
  Check svn status, svn add/delete files as needed
  Tag new Wine release "svn copy vendor\wine\dlls\cabinet\current vendor\wine\dlls\cabinet\Wine-20050211"
- Commit the vendor drop: svn commit vendor\wine -m "Wine-20050211 vendor drop"
- Determine the revision number of the last Wine tag by looking at http://svn.reactos.com/viewcvs/tags/
  and finding the last Wine-yyyymmdd-sync tag, e.g. Wine-20050111-sync had rev 13007
- For each component shared with Wine (e.g. cabinet):
- "cd reactos\lib\cabinet"
- Check for changes in the ReactOS tree: "svn diff -r 13007" (13007 is the revno of the previous sync).
  If any changes are found, see if they're present in the Wine code. If not, submit to WineHQ
  if apropriate.
- Merge in Wine changes:
  "svn merge svn://svn.reactos.com/vendor/wine/dlls/cabinet/Wine-20050111
   svn://svn.reactos.com/vendor/wine/dlls/cabinet/current"
- Fix any merge conflicts
- Build and test (building will sometimes require adjusting header files)
- Check which files were changed: "svn status"
- For each of the changed files, get the WineHQ CVS log. Copy author and CVS commit message into a
  commit log
- Commit changed files "svn commit" using generated commit log as commit message
