 *             chm_lib.h - CHM archive manipulation routines               *
 *                           -------------------                           *
 *                                                                         *
 *  author:     Jed Wing <jedwin@ugcs.caltech.edu>                         *
 *  version:    0.3                                                        *
 *  notes:      These routines are meant for the manipulation of microsoft *
 *              .chm (compiled html help) files, but may likely be used    *
 *              for the manipulation of any ITSS archive, if ever ITSS     *
 *              archives are used for any other purpose.                   *
 *                                                                         *
 *              Note also that the section names are statically handled.   *
 *              To be entirely correct, the section names should be read   *
 *              from the section names meta-file, and then the various     *
 *              content sections and the "transforms" to apply to the data *
 *              they contain should be inferred from the section name and  *
 *              the meta-files referenced using that name; however, all of *
 *              the files I've been able to get my hands on appear to have *
 *              only two sections: Uncompressed and MSCompressed.          *
 *              Additionally, the ITSS.DLL file included with Windows does *
 *              not appear to handle any different transforms than the     *
 *              simple LZX-transform.  Furthermore, the list of transforms *
 *              to apply is broken, in that only half the required space   *
 *              is allocated for the list.  (It appears as though the      *
 *              space is allocated for ASCII strings, but the strings are  *
 *              written as unicode.  As a result, only the first half of   *
 *              the string appears.)  So this is probably not too big of   *
 *              a deal, at least until CHM v4 (MS .lit files), which also  *
 *              incorporate encryption, of some description.               *
