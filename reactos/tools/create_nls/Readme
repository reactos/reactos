Create_nls - .nls file creation tool
------------------------------------

Create_nls is a tool to create binary .nls files from codepage mapping
files provided by Unicode Inc. Due to the confusing license these files
are not part of the ReactOS source tree.


You can easily download the files from 'http://www.unicode.org/public' or
'ftp://ftp.unicode.org/pub'. Download the directory structure of the web/ftp
site into the unicode.org subdirectory and create_nls will build the .nls
files.

Makefile targets:
	'make':            builds create_nls tool.
	'make clean':      deletes all executable and object files
	'make nls':        generates binary .nls files.
	'make clean_nls':  deletes binary .nls files.

Since the binary .nls files are part of the ReactOS source tree it is not
necessary to build these files yourself. Therefore create_nls is not
integrated with the main makefile. You will have to build and run it
separately.
