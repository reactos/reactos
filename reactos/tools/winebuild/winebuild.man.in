.SH NAME
winebuild \- Wine dll builder
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI winebuild\  [options]\ [input\ files]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B winebuild
generates the assembly files that are necessary to build a Wine dll,
which is basically a Win32 dll encapsulated inside a Unix library.
.PP
.B winebuild
has different modes, depending on what kind of file it is asked to
generate. The mode is specified by one of the mode options specified
below. In addition to the mode option, various other command-line
option can be specified, as described in the \fBOPTIONS\fR section.
.SH "MODE OPTIONS"
You have to specify exactly one of the following options, depending on
what you want winebuild to generate.
.TP
.BI \--dll
Build an assembly file from a .spec file (see \fBSPEC FILE SYNTAX\fR
for details), or from a standard Windows .def file. The .spec/.def
file is specified via the -E option. The resulting file must be
assembled and linked to the other object files to build a working Wine
dll.  In this mode, the
.I input files
should be the list of all object files that will be linked into the
final dll, to allow
.B winebuild
to get the list of all undefined symbols that need to be imported from
other dlls.
.TP
.BI \--exe
Build an assembly file for an executable. This is basically the same as
the --dll mode except that it doesn't require a .spec/.def file as input,
since an executable need not export functions. Some executables however
do export functions, and for those a .spec/.def file can be specified via
the -E option. The executable is named from the .spec/.def file name if 
present, or explicitly through the -F option. The resulting file must be 
assembled and linked to the other object files to build a working Wine 
executable, and all the other object files must be listed as
.I input files.
.TP
.BI \--def
Build a .def file from a spec file. The .spec file is specified via the
-E option. This is used when building dlls with a PE (Win32) compiler.
.TP
.B \--relay16
Generate the assembly code for the 16-bit relay routines. This is for
Wine internal usage only, you should never need to use this option.
.TP
.B \--relay32
Generate the assembly code for the 32-bit relay routines. This is for
Wine internal usage only, you should never need to use this option.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \--as-cmd= as-command
Specify the command to use to compile assembly files; the default is
\fBas\fR.
.TP
.BI \-d,\ --delay-lib= name
Set the delayed import mode for the specified library, which must be
one of the libraries imported with the \fB-l\fR option. Delayed mode
means that the library won't be loaded until a function imported from
it is actually called.
.TP
.BI \-D\  symbol
Ignored for compatibility with the C compiler.
.TP
.BI \-e,\ --entry= function
Specify the module entry point function; if not specified, the default
is
.B DllMain
for dlls, and
.B main
for executables (if the standard C
.B main
is not defined,
.B WinMain
is used instead). This is only valid for Win32 modules.
.TP
.BI \-E,\ --export= filename
Specify a .spec file (see \fBSPEC FILE SYNTAX\fR for details), 
or a standard Windows .def file that defines the exports
of the DLL or executable that is being built.
.TP
.B \--external-symbols
Allow linking to external symbols directly from the spec
file. Normally symbols exported by a dll have to be defined in the dll
itself; this option makes it possible to use symbols defined in
another Unix library (for symbols defined in another dll, a
.I forward
specification must be used instead).
.TP
.BI \-f\  flags
Ignored for compatibility with the C compiler.
.TP
.BI \-F,\ --filename= filename
Set the file name of the module. The default is to use the base name
of the spec file (without any extension).
.TP
.B \-h, --help
Display a usage message and exit.
.TP
.BI \-H,\ --heap= size
Specify the size of the module local heap in bytes (only valid for
Win16 modules); default is no local heap.
.TP
.BI \-i,\ --ignore= [-]symbol[,[-]symbol]
Specify a list of symbols that should be ignored when resolving
undefined symbols against the imported libraries. This forces these
symbols to be resolved from the Unix C library (or from another Unix
library linked with the application). If a symbol is prefixed by '-'
it is removed from the list instead of being added; a stand-alone '-'
clears the whole list.
.TP
.BI \-I\  directory
Ignored for compatibility with the C compiler.
.TP
.B \-k, --kill-at
Remove the stdcall decorations from the symbol names in the
generated .def file. Only meaningful in \fB--def\fR mode.
.TP
.BI \-K\  flags
Ignored for compatibility with the C compiler.
.TP
.BI \--ld-cmd= ld-command
Specify the command to use to link the object files; the default is
\fBld\fR.
.TP
.BI \-L,\ --library-path= directory
Append the specified directory to the list of directories that are
searched for import libraries.
.TP
.BI \-l,\ --library= name
Import the specified library, looking for a corresponding
\fIlibname.def\fR file in the directories specified with the \fB-L\fR
option.
.TP
.BI \-M,\ --main-module= module
Specify that we are building a 16-bit dll, that will ultimately be
linked together with the 32-bit dll specified in \fImodule\fR.  Only
meaningful in \fB--dll\fR mode.
.TP
.BI \-N,\ --dll-name= dllname
Set the internal name of the module. It is only used in Win16
modules. The default is to use the base name of the spec file (without
any extension). This is used for KERNEL, since it lives in
KRNL386.EXE. It shouldn't be needed otherwise.
.TP
.BI \--nm-cmd= nm-command
Specify the command to use to get the list of undefined symbols; the
default is \fBnm\fR.
.TP
.BI --nxcompat= yes|no
Specify whether the module is compatible with no-exec support. The
default is yes.
.TP
.BI \-o,\ --output= file
Set the name of the output file (default is standard output). If the
output file name end in \fB.o\fR, the text output is sent to a
temporary file that is then assembled to produce the specified .o
file.
.TP
.BI \-r,\ --res= rsrc.res
Load resources from the specified binary resource file. The
\fIrsrc.res\fR file can be produced from a source resource file with
.BR wrc(1)
(or with a Windows resource compiler).
.br
This option is only necessary for Win16 resource files, the Win32 ones
can simply listed as
.I input files
and will automatically be handled correctly (though the
.B \-r
option will also work for Win32 files).
.TP
.B --save-temps
Do not delete the various temporary files that \fBwinebuild\fR generates.
.TP
.BI --subsystem= subsystem[:major[.minor]]
Set the subsystem of the executable, which can be one of the following:
.br
.B console
for a command line executable,
.br
.B windows
for a graphical executable,
.br
.B native
for a native-mode dll.
.br
The entry point of a command line executable is a normal C \fBmain\fR
function. A \fBwmain\fR function can be used instead if you need the
argument array to use Unicode strings. A graphical executable has a
\fBWinMain\fR entry point.
.br
Optionally a major and minor subsystem version can also be specified;
the default subsystem version is 4.0.
.TP
.BI --target= cpu-manufacturer[-kernel]-os
Specify the target CPU and platform on which the generated code will
be built. The target specification is in the standard autoconf format
as returned by config.sub.
.TP
.BI \-u,\ --undefined= symbol
Add \fIsymbol\fR to the list of undefined symbols when invoking the
linker. This makes it possible to force a specific module of a static
library to be included when resolving imports.
.TP
.B \-v, --verbose
Display the various subcommands being invoked by
.B winebuild.
.TP
.B \--version
Display the program version and exit.
.TP
.B \-w, --warnings
Turn on warnings.
.SH "SPEC FILE SYNTAX"
.SS "General syntax"
A spec file should contain a list of ordinal declarations. The general
syntax is the following:
.PP
.I ordinal functype
.RI [ flags ]\  exportname \ \fB(\fR\ [ args... ] \ \fB) \ [ handler ]
.br
.IB ordinal\  variable
.RI [ flags ]\  exportname \ \fB(\fR\ [ data... ] \ \fB)
.br
.IB ordinal\  extern
.RI [ flags ]\  exportname \ [ symbolname ]
.br
.IB ordinal\  stub
.RI [ flags ]\  exportname
.br
.IB ordinal\  equate
.RI [ flags ]\  exportname\ data
.br
.BI #\  comments
.PP
Declarations must fit on a single line, except if the end of line is
escaped using a backslash character. The
.B #
character anywhere in a line causes the rest of the line to be ignored
as a comment.
.PP
.I ordinal
specifies the ordinal number corresponding to the entry point, or '@'
for automatic ordinal allocation (Win32 only).
.PP
.I flags
is a series of optional flags, preceded by a '-' character. The
supported flags are:
.RS
.TP
.B -norelay
The entry point is not displayed in relay debugging traces (Win32
only).
.TP
.B -noname
The entry point will be exported by ordinal instead of by name. The
name is still available for importing.
.TP
.B -ret16
The function returns a 16-bit value (Win16 only).
.TP
.B -ret64
The function returns a 64-bit value (Win32 only).
.TP
.B -i386
The entry point is only available on i386 platforms.
.TP
.B -register
The function uses CPU register to pass arguments.
.TP
.B -private
The function cannot be imported from other dlls, it can only be
accessed through GetProcAddress.
.TP
.B -ordinal
The entry point will be imported by ordinal instead of by name. The
name is still exported.
.SS "Function ordinals"
Syntax:
.br
.I ordinal functype
.RI [ flags ]\  exportname \ \fB(\fR\ [ args... ] \ \fB) \ [ handler ]
.br

This declaration defines a function entry point.  The prototype defined by
.IR exportname \ \fB(\fR\ [ args... ] \ \fB)
specifies the name available for dynamic linking and the format of the
arguments. '@' can be used instead of
.I exportname
for ordinal-only exports.
.PP
.I functype
should be one of:
.RS
.TP
.B stdcall
for a normal Win32 function
.TP
.B pascal
for a normal Win16 function
.TP
.B cdecl
for a Win16 or Win32 function using the C calling convention
.TP
.B varargs
for a Win16 or Win32 function using the C calling convention with a
variable number of arguments
.RE
.PP
.I args
should be one or several of:
.RS
.TP
.B word
(16-bit unsigned value)
.TP
.B s_word
(16-bit signed word)
.TP
.B long
(32-bit value)
.TP
.B double
(64-bit value)
.TP
.B ptr
(linear pointer)
.TP
.B str
(linear pointer to a null-terminated ASCII string)
.TP
.B wstr
(linear pointer to a null-terminated Unicode string)
.TP
.B segptr
(segmented pointer)
.TP
.B segstr
(segmented pointer to a null-terminated ASCII string).
.HP
.RB Only\  ptr ,\  str ,\  wstr ,\  long\  and\  double
are valid for Win32 functions.
.RE
.PP
.I handler
is the name of the actual C function that will implement that entry
point in 32-bit mode. The handler can also be specified as
.IB dllname . function
to define a forwarded function (one whose implementation is in another
dll). If
.I handler
is not specified, it is assumed to be identical to
.I exportname.
.PP
This first example defines an entry point for the 32-bit GetFocus()
call:
.IP
@ stdcall GetFocus() GetFocus
.PP
This second example defines an entry point for the 16-bit
CreateWindow() call (the ordinal 100 is just an example); it also
shows how long lines can be split using a backslash:
.IP
100 pascal CreateWindow(ptr ptr long s_word s_word s_word \\
    s_word word word word ptr) WIN_CreateWindow
.PP
To declare a function using a variable number of arguments, specify
the function as
.B varargs
and declare it in the C file with a '...' parameter for a Win32
function, or with an extra VA_LIST16 argument for a Win16 function.
See the wsprintf* functions in user.exe.spec and user32.spec for an
example.
.SS "Variable ordinals"
Syntax:
.br
.IB ordinal\  variable
.RI [ flags ]\  exportname \ \fB(\fR\ [ data... ] \ \fB)
.PP
This declaration defines data storage as 32-bit words at the ordinal
specified.
.I exportname
will be the name available for dynamic
linking.
.I data
can be a decimal number or a hex number preceded by "0x".  The
following example defines the variable VariableA at ordinal 2 and
containing 4 ints:
.IP
2 variable VariableA(-1 0xff 0 0)
.PP
This declaration only works in Win16 spec files. In Win32 you should
use
.B extern
instead (see below).
.SS "Extern ordinals"
Syntax:
.br
.IB ordinal\  extern
.RI [ flags ]\  exportname \ [ symbolname ]
.PP
This declaration defines an entry that simply maps to a C symbol
(variable or function). It only works in Win32 spec files.
.I exportname
will point to the symbol
.I symbolname
that must be defined in the C code. Alternatively, it can be of the
form
.IB dllname . symbolname
to define a forwarded symbol (one whose implementation is in another
dll). If
.I symbolname
is not specified, it is assumed to be identical to
.I exportname.
.SS "Stub ordinals"
Syntax:
.br
.IB ordinal\  stub
.RI [ flags ]\  exportname
.PP
This declaration defines a stub function. It makes the name and
ordinal available for dynamic linking, but will terminate execution
with an error message if the function is ever called.
.SS "Equate ordinals"
Syntax:
.br
.IB ordinal\  equate
.RI [ flags ]\  exportname\ data
.PP
This declaration defines an ordinal as an absolute value.
.I exportname
will be the name available for dynamic linking.
.I data
can be a decimal number or a hex number preceded by "0x".
