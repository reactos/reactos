/*
 * traceroute host  - trace the route ip packets follow going to "host".
 *
 * Attempt to trace the route an ip packet would follow to some
 * internet host.  We find out intermediate hops by launching probe
 * packets with a small ttl (time to live) then listening for an
 * icmp "time exceeded" reply from a gateway.  We start our probes
 * with a ttl of one and increase by one until we get an icmp "port
 * unreachable" (which means we got to "host") or hit a max (which
 * defaults to 30 hops & can be changed with the -m flag).  Three
 * probes (change with -q flag) are sent at each ttl setting and a
 * line is printed showing the ttl, address of the gateway and
 * round trip time of each probe.  If the probe answers come from
 * different gateways, the address of each responding system will
 * be printed.  If there is no response within a 5 sec. timeout
 * interval (changed with the -w flag), a "*" is printed for that
 * probe.
 *
 * Probe packets are UDP format.  We don't want the destination
 * host to process them so the destination port is set to an
 * unlikely value (if some clod on the destination is using that
 * value, it can be changed with the -p flag).
 *
 * A sample use might be:
 *
 *     [yak 71]% traceroute nis.nsf.net.
 *     traceroute to nis.nsf.net (35.1.1.48), 30 hops max, 56 byte packet

 *
 * Note that lines 2 & 3 are the same.  This is due to a buggy
 * kernel on the 2nd hop system -- lbl-csam.arpa -- that forwards
 * packets with a zero ttl.

 *
 * (I start to see why I'm having so much trouble with mail to
 * MIT.)  Note that the gateways 12, 14, 15, 16 & 17 hops away
 * either don't send ICMP "time exceeded" messages or send them
 * with a ttl too small to reach us.  14 - 17 are running the
 * MIT C Gateway code that doesn't send "time exceeded"s.  God
 * only knows what's going on with 12.
 *
 * The silent gateway 12 in the above may be the result of a bug in
 * the 4.[23]BSD network code (and its derivatives):  4.x (x <= 3)
 * sends an unreachable message using whatever ttl remains in the
 * original datagram.  Since, for gateways, the remaining ttl is
 * zero, the icmp "time exceeded" is guaranteed to not make it back
 * to us.  The behavior of this bug is slightly more interesting
 * when it appears on the destination system:
 *
 *      1  helios.ee.lbl.gov (128.3.112.1)  0 ms  0 ms  0 ms
 *      2  lilac-dmc.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.216.1)  39 ms  19 ms  39 ms
 *      3  lilac-dmc.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.216.1)  19 ms  39 ms  19 ms
 *      4  ccngw-ner-cc.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.136.23)  39 ms  40 ms  19 ms
 *      5  ccn-nerif35.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.168.35)  39 ms  39 ms  39 ms

 *      9  * * *
 *     10  * * *
 *     11  * * *
 *     12  * * *
 *     13  rip.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.131.22)  59 ms !  39 ms !  39 ms !
 *
 * Notice that there are 12 "gateways" (13 is the final
 * destination) and exactly the last half of them are "missing".
 * What's really happening is that rip (a Sun-3 running Sun OS3.5)
 * is using the ttl from our arriving datagram as the ttl in its
 * icmp reply.  So, the reply will time out on the return path
 * (with no notice sent to anyone since icmp's aren't sent for
 * icmp's) until we probe with a ttl that's at least twice the path
 * length.  I.e., rip is really only 7 hops away.  A reply that
 * returns with a ttl of 1 is a clue this problem exists.
 * Traceroute prints a "!" after the time if the ttl is <= 1.
 * Since vendors ship a lot of obsolete (DEC's Ultrix, Sun 3.x) or
 * non-standard (HPUX) software, expect to see this problem
 * frequently and/or take care picking the target host of your
 * probes.
 *
 * Other possible annotations after the time are !H, !N, !P (got a host,
 * network or protocol unreachable, respectively), !S or !F (source
 * route failed or fragmentation needed -- neither of these should
 * ever occur and the associated gateway is busted if you see one).  If
 * almost all the probes result in some kind of unreachable, traceroute
 * will give up and exit.
 *
 * Notes
 * -----
 * This program must be run by root or be setuid.  (I suggest that
 * you *don't* make it setuid -- casual use could result in a lot
 * of unnecessary traffic on our poor, congested nets.)
 *
 * This program requires a kernel mod that does not appear in any
 * system available from Berkeley:  A raw ip socket using proto
 * IPPROTO_RAW must interpret the data sent as an ip datagram (as
 * opposed to data to be wrapped in a ip datagram).  See the README
 * file that came with the source to this program for a description
 * of the mods I made to /sys/netinet/raw_ip.c.  Your mileage may
 * vary.  But, again, ANY 4.x (x < 4) BSD KERNEL WILL HAVE TO BE
 * MODIFIED TO RUN THIS PROGRAM.
 *
 * The udp port usage may appear bizarre (well, ok, it is bizarre).
 * The problem is that an icmp message only contains 8 bytes of
 * data from the original datagram.  8 bytes is the size of a udp
 * header so, if we want to associate replies with the original
 * datagram, the necessary information must be encoded into the
 * udp header (the ip id could be used but there's no way to
 * interlock with the kernel's assignment of ip id's and, anyway,
 * it would have taken a lot more kernel hacking to allow this
 * code to set the ip id).  So, to allow two or more users to
 * use traceroute simultaneously, we use this task's pid as the
 * source port (the high bit is set to move the port number out
 * of the "likely" range).  To keep track of which probe is being
 * replied to (so times and/or hop counts don't get confused by a
 * reply that was delayed in transit), we increment the destination
 * port number before each probe.
 *
 * Don't use this as a coding example.  I was trying to find a
 * routing problem and this code sort-of popped out after 48 hours
 * without sleep.  I was amazed it ever compiled, much less ran.
 *
 * I stole the idea for this program from Steve Deering.  Since
 * the first release, I've learned that had I attended the right
 * IETF working group meetings, I also could have stolen it from Guy
 * Almes or Matt Mathis.  I don't know (or care) who came up with
 * the idea first.  I envy the originators' perspicacity and I'm
 * glad they didn't keep the idea a secret.
 *
 * Tim Seaver, Ken Adelman and C. Philip Wood provided bug fixes and/or
 * enhancements to the original distribution.
 *
 * I've hacked up a round-trip-route version of this that works by
 * sending a loose-source-routed udp datagram through the destination
 * back to yourself.  Unfortunately, SO many gateways botch source
 * routing, the thing is almost worthless.  Maybe one day...
