REM Virtual DOS Machine (VDM) Default Startup File

REM NOTE: NTVDM does not use CONFIG.BAT as the default
REM environment settings file when running a DOS application. To
REM change the default settings for the VDM, change this file
REM instead. However, if a DOS Shortcut (PIF) is used, then
REM the settings found in the PIF file will be used instead.

REM Echo Output Option
REM ==================
REM     When starting up a DOS application, by default, no output
REM     text is shown to the user as the application starts
REM     up. To display information from both CONFIG.NT and
REM     AUTOEXEC.NT, use the option, 'echoconfig'.
REM echoconfig

REM Command Prompt Option
REM =====================
REM     If the user returns to the Command Prompt either from a TSR,
REM     or while running a DOS application, by default, VDM runs
REM     COMMAND.COM. To run cmd.exe instead, use the option, 'ntcmdprompt'.
REM     However, if COMMAND.COM cannot be found, VDM will use this option
REM     regardless if it's disabled or not.
ntcmdprompt

REM DOS-Only Mode
REM =============
REM     By default, any DOS application can run another application,
REM     regardless if it's DOS-based or not. To prevent DOS applications
REM     from running non-DOS applications, and therefore possibly preventing
REM     disruption of the TSR, use the option 'dosonly'.

REM Expanded Memory Manager (EMM)
REM =============================
REM     Syntax = EMM [A=AltRegSets] [B=BaseSegment] [RAM]
REM
REM     A = Alternative Mapping Register (AltRegSets)
REM         * Determines the Alternative Mapping Register Sets supported by the system.
REM           The supported values goes from 1 to 255.
REM         * The default value is 8.
REM     B = Base Segment
REM         * The default value is 0x4000.
REM     Random Access Memory (RAM)
REM         * If used, then only allocate 64kb address space from the Upper Memory
REM           Block (UMB) for EMM page frames, while allowing the rest (if any) to be
REM           used by NTVDM for loadhigh and devicehigh commands.
REM         * By default, all available and possible UMB will be used for page frames.
REM
REM     The size of a program's EMM is determined by it's given PIF file. But
REM     if no PIF file is provided, the default settings will be used (_default.pif).
REM     But if the size of the given PIF file is zero, then the EMM will be disabled
REM     and the options below will be ignored.
REM EMM A=8 B=0x4000 64

REM Disable PC Speaker Audio
REM ========================
REM     Disables the playback of PC Speaker Audio.
