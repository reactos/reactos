ToDo:
	- Find and fix bugs.
	- Enable NFS exporting of NTFS.
	- Implement aops->set_page_dirty() in order to take control of buffer
	  dirtying. Not having it means if page_has_buffers(), all buffers
	  will be dirtied with the page. And if not they won't be. That is
	  fine for the moment but will break once we enable metadata updates.
	- Implement sops->dirty_inode() to implement {a,m,c} time updates and
	  such things.
	- Implement sops->write_inode().
	- In between ntfs_prepare/commit_write, need exclusion between
	  simultaneous file extensions. Need perhaps an NInoResizeUnderway()
	  flag which we can set in ntfs_prepare_write() and clear again in
	  ntfs_commit_write(). Just have to be careful in readpage/writepage,
	  as well as in truncate, that we play nice... We might need to have
	  a data_size field in the ntfs_inode to store the real attribute
	  length. Also need to be careful with initialized_size extention in
	  ntfs_prepare_write. Basically, just be _very_ careful in this code...
	  OTOH, perhaps i_sem, which is held accross generic_file_write is
	  sufficient for synchronisation here. We then just need to make sure
	  ntfs_readpage/writepage/truncate interoperate properly with us.

2.1.5 - Fix minor bug in attribute list attribute handling.

	- Fix bug in attribute list handling.  Actually it is not as much a bug
	  as too much protection in that we were not allowing attribute lists
	  which waste space on disk while Windows XP clearly allows it and in
	  fact creates such attribute lists so our driver was failing.
	- Update NTFS documentation ready for 2.6 kernel release.

2.1.4 - Reduce compiler requirements.

	- Remove all uses of unnamed structs and unions in the driver to make
	  old and newer gcc versions happy. Makes it a bit uglier IMO but at
	  least people will stop hassling me about it.

2.1.3 - Important bug fixes in corner cases.

	- super.c::parse_ntfs_boot_sector(): Correct the check for 64-bit
	  clusters. (Philipp Thomas)
	- attrib.c::load_attribute_list(): Fix bug when initialized_size is a
	  multiple of the block_size but not the cluster size. (Szabolcs
	  Szakacsits <szaka@sienet.hu>)

2.1.2 - Important bug fixes aleviating the hangs in statfs.

	- Fix buggy free cluster and free inode determination logic.

2.1.1 - Minor updates.

	- Add handling for initialized_size != data_size in compressed files.
	- Reduce function local stack usage from 0x3d4 bytes to just noise in
	  fs/ntfs/upcase.c. (Randy Dunlap <rddunlap@osdl.ord>)
	- Remove compiler warnings for newer gcc.

2.1.0 - First steps towards write support: implement file overwrite.

	- Add configuration option for developmental write support with an
	  appropriately scary configuration help text.
	- Initial implementation of fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_writepage() and its
	  helper fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_write_block(). This enables mmap(2) based
	  overwriting of existing files on ntfs. Note: Resident files are
	  only written into memory, and not written out to disk at present, so
	  avoid writing to files smaller than about 1kiB.
	- Initial implementation of fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_prepare_write(), its
	  helper fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_prepare_nonresident_write() and their
	  counterparts, fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_commit_write(), and
	  fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_commit_nonresident_write(), respectively. Also,
	  add generic_file_write() to the ntfs file operations (fs/ntfs/file.c).
	  This enables write(2) based overwriting of existing files on ntfs.
	  Note: As with mmap(2) based overwriting, resident files are only
	  written into memory, and not written out to disk at present, so avoid
	  writing to files smaller than about 1kiB.
	- Implement ->truncate (fs/ntfs/inode.c::ntfs_truncate()) and
	  ->setattr() (fs/ntfs/inode.c::ntfs_setattr()) inode operations for
	  files with the purpose of intercepting and aborting all i_size
	  changes which we do not support yet. ntfs_truncate() actually only
	  emits a warning message but AFAICS our interception of i_size changes
	  elsewhere means ntfs_truncate() never gets called for i_size changes.
	  It is only called from generic_file_write() when we fail in
	  ntfs_prepare_{,nonresident_}write() in order to discard any
	  instantiated buffers beyond i_size. Thus i_size is not actually
	  changed so our warning message is enough. Unfortunately it is not
	  possible to easily determine if i_size is being changed or not hence
	  we just emit an appropriately worded error message.

2.0.25 - Small bug fixes and cleanups.

	- Unlock the page in an out of memory error code path in
	  fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_read_block().
	- If fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_read_page() is called on an uptodate page,
	  just unlock the page and return. (This can happen due to ->writepage
	  clearing PageUptodate() during write out of MstProtected()
	  attributes.
	- Remove leaked write code again.

2.0.24 - Cleanups.

	- Treat BUG_ON() as ASSERT() not VERIFY(), i.e. do not use side effects
	  inside BUG_ON(). (Adam J. Richter)
	- Split logical OR expressions inside BUG_ON() into individual BUG_ON()
	  calls for improved debugging. (Adam J. Richter)
	- Add errors flag to the ntfs volume state, accessed via
	  NVol{,Set,Clear}Errors(vol).
	- Do not allow read-write remounts of read-only volumes with errors.
	- Clarify comment for ntfs file operation sendfile which was added by
	  Christoph Hellwig a while ago (just using generic_file_sendfile())
	  to say that ntfs ->sendfile is only used for the case where the
	  source data is on the ntfs partition and the destination is
	  somewhere else, i.e. nothing we need to concern ourselves with.
	- Add generic_file_write() as our ntfs file write operation.

2.0.23 - Major bug fixes (races, deadlocks, non-i386 architectures).

	- Massive internal locking changes to mft record locking. Fixes lock
	  recursion and replaces the mrec_lock read/write semaphore with a
	  mutex. Also removes the now superfluous mft_count. This fixes several
	  race conditions and deadlocks, especially in the future write code.
	- Fix ntfs over loopback for compressed files by adding an
	  optimization barrier. (gcc was screwing up otherwise ?)
	- Miscellaneous cleanups all over the code and a fix or two in error
	  handling code paths.
	Thanks go to Christoph Hellwig for pointing out the following two:
	- Remove now unused function fs/ntfs/malloc.h::vmalloc_nofs().
	- Fix ntfs_free() for ia64 and parisc by checking for VMALLOC_END, too.

2.0.22 - Cleanups, mainly to ntfs_readdir(), and use C99 initializers.

	- Change fs/ntfs/dir.c::ntfs_reddir() to only read/write ->f_pos once
	  at entry/exit respectively.
	- Use C99 initializers for structures.
	- Remove unused variable blocks from fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_read_block().

2.0.21 - Check for, and refuse to work with too large files/directories/volumes.

	- Limit volume size at mount time to 2TiB on architectures where
	  unsigned long is 32-bits (fs/ntfs/super.c::parse_ntfs_boot_sector()).
	  This is the most we can do without overflowing the 32-bit limit of
	  the block device size imposed on us by sb_bread() and sb_getblk()
	  for the time being.
	- Limit file/directory size at open() time to 16TiB on architectures
	  where unsigned long is 32-bits (fs/ntfs/file.c::ntfs_file_open() and
	  fs/ntfs/dir.c::ntfs_dir_open()). This is the most we can do without
	  overflowing the page cache page index.

2.0.20 - Support non-resident directory index bitmaps, fix page leak in readdir.

	- Move the directory index bitmap to use an attribute inode instead of
	  having special fields for it inside the ntfs inode structure. This
	  means that the index bitmaps now use the page cache for i/o, too,
	  and also as a side effect we get support for non-resident index
	  bitmaps for free.
	- Simplify/cleanup error handling in fs/ntfs/dir.c::ntfs_readdir() and
	  fix a page leak that manifested itself in some cases.
	- Add fs/ntfs/inode.c::ntfs_put_inode(), which we need to release the
	  index bitmap inode on the final iput().

2.0.19 - Fix race condition, improvements, and optimizations in i/o interface.

	- Apply block optimization added to fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_read_block()
	  to fs/ntfs/compress.c::ntfs_file_read_compressed_block() as well.
	- Drop the "file" from ntfs_file_read_compressed_block().
	- Rename fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_enb_buffer_read_async() to
	  ntfs_end_buffer_async_read() (more like the fs/buffer.c counterpart).
	- Update ntfs_end_buffer_async_read() with the improved logic from
	  its updated counterpart fs/buffer.c::end_buffer_async_read(). Apply
	  further logic improvements to better determine when we set PageError.
	- Update submission of buffers in fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_read_block() to
	  check for the buffers being uptodate first in line with the updated
	  fs/buffer.c::block_read_full_page(). This plugs a small race
	  condition.

2.0.18 - Fix race condition in reading of compressed files.

	- There was a narrow window between checking a buffer head for being
	  uptodate and locking it in ntfs_file_read_compressed_block(). We now
	  lock the buffer and then check whether it is uptodate or not.

2.0.17 - Cleanups and optimizations - shrinking the ToDo list.

	- Modify fs/ntfs/inode.c::ntfs_read_locked_inode() to return an error
	  code and update callers, i.e. ntfs_iget(), to pass that error code
	  up instead of just using -EIO.
	- Modifications to super.c to ensure that both mount and remount
	  cannot set any write related options when the driver is compiled
	  read-only.
	- Optimize block resolution in fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_read_block() to
	  cache the current run list element. This should improve performance
	  when reading very large and/or very fragmented data.

2.0.16 - Convert access to $MFT/$BITMAP to attribute inode API.

	- Fix a stupid bug introduced in 2.0.15 where we were unmapping the
	  wrong inode in fs/ntfs/inode.c::ntfs_attr_iget().
	- Fix debugging check in fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_read_block().
	- Convert $MFT/$BITMAP access to attribute inode API and remove all
	  remnants of the ugly mftbmp address space and operations hack. This
	  means we finally have only one readpage function as well as only one
	  async io completion handler. Yey! The mft bitmap is now just an
	  attribute inode and is accessed from vol->mftbmp_ino just as if it
	  were a normal file. Fake inodes rule. (-:

2.0.15 - Fake inodes based attribute i/o via the pagecache, fixes and cleanups.

	- Fix silly bug in fs/ntfs/super.c::parse_options() which was causing
	  remounts to fail when the partition had an entry in /etc/fstab and
	  the entry specified the nls= option.
	- Apply same macro magic used in fs/ntfs/inode.h to fs/ntfs/volume.h to
	  expand all the helper functions NVolFoo(), NVolSetFoo(), and
	  NVolClearFoo().
	- Move copyright statement from driver initialisation message to
	  module description (fs/super.c). This makes the initialisation
	  message fit on one line and fits in better with rest of kernel.
	- Update fs/ntfs/attrib.c::map_run_list() to work on both real and
	  attribute inodes, and both for files and directories.
	- Implement fake attribute inodes allowing all attribute i/o to go via
	  the page cache and to use all the normal vfs/mm functionality:
	  - Add ntfs_attr_iget() and its helper ntfs_read_locked_attr_inode()
	    to fs/ntfs/inode.c.
	  - Add needed cleanup code to ntfs_clear_big_inode().
	- Merge address space operations for files and directories (aops.c),
	  now just have ntfs_aops:
	  - Rename:
		end_buffer_read_attr_async() ->	ntfs_end_buffer_read_async(),
		ntfs_attr_read_block()	     ->	ntfs_read_block(),
		ntfs_file_read_page()	     ->	ntfs_readpage().
	  - Rewrite fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_readpage() to work on both real and
	    attribute inodes, and both for files and directories.
	  - Remove obsolete fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_mst_readpage().

2.0.14 - Run list merging code cleanup, minor locking changes, typo fixes.

	- Change fs/ntfs/super.c::ntfs_statfs() to not rely on BKL by moving
	  the locking out of super.c::get_nr_free_mft_records() and taking and
	  dropping the mftbmp_lock rw_semaphore in ntfs_statfs() itself.
	- Bring attribute run list merging code (fs/ntfs/attrib.c) in sync with
	  current userspace ntfs library code. This means that if a merge
	  fails the original run lists are always left unmodified instead of
	  being silently corrupted.
	- Misc typo fixes.

2.0.13 - Use iget5_locked() in preparation for fake inodes and small cleanups.

	- Remove nr_mft_bits and the now superfluous union with nr_mft_records
	  from ntfs_volume structure.
	- Remove nr_lcn_bits and the now superfluous union with nr_clusters
	  from ntfs_volume structure.
	- Use iget5_locked() and friends instead of conventional iget(). Wrap
	  the call in fs/ntfs/inode.c::ntfs_iget() and update callers of iget()
	  to use ntfs_iget(). Leave only one iget() call at mount time so we
	  don't need an ntfs_iget_mount().
	- Change fs/ntfs/inode.c::ntfs_new_extent_inode() to take mft_no as an
	  additional argument.

2.0.12 - Initial cleanup of address space operations following 2.0.11 changes.

	- Merge fs/ntfs/aops.c::end_buffer_read_mst_async() and
	  fs/ntfs/aops.c::end_buffer_read_file_async() into one function
	  fs/ntfs/aops.c::end_buffer_read_attr_async() using NInoMstProtected()
	  to determine whether to apply mst fixups or not.
	- Above change allows merging fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_file_read_block()
	  and fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_mst_readpage() into one function
	  fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_attr_read_block(). Also, create a tiny wrapper
	  fs/ntfs/aops.c::ntfs_mst_readpage() to transform the parameters from
	  the VFS readpage function prototype to the ntfs_attr_read_block()
	  function prototype.

2.0.11 - Initial preparations for fake inode based attribute i/o.

	- Move definition of ntfs_inode_state_bits to fs/ntfs/inode.h and
	  do some macro magic (adapted from include/linux/buffer_head.h) to
	  expand all the helper functions NInoFoo(), NInoSetFoo(), and
	  NInoClearFoo().
	- Add new flag to ntfs_inode_state_bits: NI_Sparse.
	- Add new fields to ntfs_inode structure to allow use of fake inodes
	  for attribute i/o: type, name, name_len. Also add new state bits:
	  NI_Attr, which, if set, indicates the inode is a fake inode, and
	  NI_MstProtected, which, if set, indicates the attribute uses multi
	  sector transfer protection, i.e. fixups need to be applied after
	  reads and before/after writes.
	- Rename fs/ntfs/inode.c::ntfs_{new,clear,destroy}_inode() to
	  ntfs_{new,clear,destroy}_extent_inode() and update callers.
	- Use ntfs_clear_extent_inode() in fs/ntfs/inode.c::__ntfs_clear_inode()
	  instead of ntfs_destroy_extent_inode().
	- Cleanup memory deallocations in {__,}ntfs_clear_{,big_}inode().
	- Make all operations on ntfs inode state bits use the NIno* functions.
	- Set up the new ntfs inode fields and state bits in
	  fs/ntfs/inode.c::ntfs_read_inode() and add appropriate cleanup of
	  allocated memory to __ntfs_clear_inode().
	- Cleanup ntfs_inode structure a bit for better ordering of elements
	  w.r.t. their size to allow better packing of the structure in memory.

2.0.10 - There can only be 2^32 - 1 inodes on an NTFS volume.

	- Add check at mount time to verify that the number of inodes on the
	  volume does not exceed 2^32 - 1, which is the maximum allowed for
	  NTFS according to Microsoft.
	- Change mft_no member of ntfs_inode structure to be unsigned long.
	  Update all users. This makes ntfs_inode->mft_no just a copy of struct
	  inode->i_ino. But we can't just always use struct inode->i_ino and
	  remove mft_no because extent inodes do not have an attached struct
	  inode.

2.0.9 - Decompression engine now uses a single buffer and other cleanups.

	- Change decompression engine to use a single buffer protected by a
	  spin lock instead of per-CPU buffers. (Rusty Russell)
	- Do not update cb_pos when handling a partial final page during
	  decompression of a sparse compression block, as the value is later
	  reset without being read/used. (Rusty Russell)
	- Switch to using the new KM_BIO_SRC_IRQ for atomic kmap()s. (Andrew
	  Morton)
	- Change buffer size in ntfs_readdir()/ntfs_filldir() to use
	  NLS_MAX_CHARSET_SIZE which makes the buffers almost 1kiB each but
	  it also makes everything safer so it is a good thing.
	- Miscellaneous minor cleanups to comments.

2.0.8 - Major updates for handling of case sensitivity and dcache aliasing.

	Big thanks go to Al Viro and other inhabitants of #kernel for investing
	their time to discuss the case sensitivity and dcache aliasing issues.

	- Remove unused source file fs/ntfs/attraops.c.
	- Remove show_inodes mount option(s), thus dropping support for
	  displaying of short file names.
	- Remove deprecated mount option posix.
	- Restore show_sys_files mount option.
	- Add new mount option case_sensitive, to determine if the driver
	  treats file names as case sensitive or not. If case sensitive, create
	  file names in the POSIX namespace. Otherwise create file names in the
	  LONG/WIN32 namespace. Note, files remain accessible via their short
	  file name, if it exists.
	- Remove really dumb logic bug in boot sector recovery code.
	- Fix dcache aliasing issues wrt short/long file names via changes
	  to fs/ntfs/dir.c::ntfs_lookup_inode_by_name() and
	  fs/ntfs/namei.c::ntfs_lookup():
	  - Add additional argument to ntfs_lookup_inode_by_name() in which we
	    return information about the matching file name if the case is not
	    matching or the match is a short file name. See comments above the
	    function definition for details.
	  - Change ntfs_lookup() to only create dcache entries for the correctly
	    cased file name and only for the WIN32 namespace counterpart of DOS
	    namespace file names. This ensures we have only one dentry per
	    directory and also removes all dcache aliasing issues between short
	    and long file names once we add write support. See comments above
	    function for details.
	- Fix potential 1 byte overflow in fs/ntfs/unistr.c::ntfs_ucstonls().

2.0.7 - Minor cleanups and updates for changes in core kernel code.

	- Remove much of the NULL struct element initializers.
	- Various updates to make compatible with recent kernels.
	- Remove defines of MAX_BUF_PER_PAGE and include linux/buffer_head.h
	  in fs/ntfs/ntfs.h instead.
	- Remove no longer needed KERNEL_VERSION checks. We are now in the
	  kernel proper so they are no longer needed.

2.0.6 - Major bugfix to make compatible with other kernel changes.

	- Initialize the mftbmp address space properly now that there are more
	  fields in the struct address_space. This was leading to hangs and
	  oopses on umount since 2.5.12 because of changes to other parts of
	  the kernel. We probably want a kernel generic init_address_space()
	  function...
	- Drop BKL from ntfs_readdir() after consultation with Al Viro. The
	  only caller of ->readdir() is vfs_readdir() which holds i_sem during
	  the call, and i_sem is sufficient protection against changes in the
	  directory inode (including ->i_size).
	- Use generic_file_llseek() for directories (as opposed to
	  default_llseek()) as this downs i_sem instead of the BKL which is
	  what we now need for exclusion against ->f_pos changes considering we
	  no longer take the BKL in ntfs_readdir().

2.0.5 - Major bugfix. Buffer overflow in extent inode handling.

	- No need to set old blocksize in super.c::ntfs_fill_super() as the
	  VFS does so via invocation of deactivate_super() calling
	  fs->fill_super() calling block_kill_super() which does it.
	- BKL moved from VFS into dir.c::ntfs_readdir(). (Linus Torvalds)
	  -> Do we really need it? I don't think so as we have exclusion on
	  the directory ntfs_inode rw_semaphore mrec_lock. We mmight have to
	  move the ->f_pos accesses under the mrec_lock though. Check this...
	- Fix really, really, really stupid buffer overflow in extent inode
	  handling in mft.c::map_extent_mft_record().

2.0.4 - Cleanups and updates for kernel 2.5.11.

	- Add documentation on how to use the MD driver to be able to use NTFS
	  stripe and volume sets in Linux and generally cleanup documentation
	  a bit.
	Remove all uses of kdev_t in favour of struct block_device *:
	- Change compress.c::ntfs_file_read_compressed_block() to use
	  sb_getblk() instead of getblk().
	- Change super.c::ntfs_fill_super() to use bdev_hardsect_size() instead
	  of get_hardsect_size().
	- No need to get old blocksize in super.c::ntfs_fill_super() as
	  fs/super.c::get_sb_bdev() already does this.
	- Set bh->b_bdev instead of bh->b_dev throughout aops.c.

2.0.3 - Small bug fixes, cleanups, and performance improvements.

	- Remove some dead code from mft.c.
	- Optimize readpage and read_block functions throughout aops.c so that
	  only initialized blocks are read. Non-initialized ones have their
	  buffer head mapped, zeroed, and set up to date, without scheduling
	  any i/o. Thanks to Al Viro for advice on how to avoid the device i/o.
	Thanks go to Andrew Morton for spotting the below:
	- Fix buglet in allocate_compression_buffers() error code path.
	- Call flush_dcache_page() after modifying page cache page contents in
	  ntfs_file_readpage().
	- Check for existence of page buffers throughout aops.c before calling
	  create_empty_buffers(). This happens when an I/O error occurs and the
	  read is retried. (It also happens once writing is implemented so that
	  needed doing anyway but I had left it for later...)
	- Don't BUG_ON() uptodate and/or mapped buffers throughout aops.c in
	  readpage and read_block functions. Reasoning same as above (i.e. I/O
	  error retries and future write code paths.)

2.0.2 - Minor updates and cleanups.

	- Cleanup: rename mst.c::__post_read_mst_fixup to post_write_mst_fixup
	  and cleanup the code a bit, removing the unused size parameter.
	- Change default fmask to 0177 and update documentation.
	- Change attrib.c::get_attr_search_ctx() to return the search context
	  directly instead of taking the address of a pointer. A return value
	  of NULL means the allocation failed. Updated all callers
	  appropriately.
	- Update to 2.5.9 kernel (preserving backwards compatibility) by
	  replacing all occurences of page->buffers with page_buffers(page).
	- Fix minor bugs in run list merging, also minor cleanup.
	- Updates to bootsector layout and mft mirror contents descriptions.
	- Small bug fix in error detection in unistr.c and some cleanups.
	- Grow name buffer allocations in unistr.c in aligned mutlipled of 64
	  bytes.

2.0.1 - Minor updates.

	- Make default umask correspond to documentation.
	- Improve documentation.
	- Set default mode to include execute bit. The {u,f,d}mask can be used
	  to take it away if desired. This allows binaries to be executed from
	  a mounted ntfs partition.

2.0.0 - New version number. Remove TNG from the name. Now in the kernel.

	- Add kill_super, just keeping up with the vfs changes in the kernel.
	- Repeat some changes from tng-0.0.8 that somehow got lost on the way
	  from the CVS import into BitKeeper.
	- Begin to implement proper handling of allocated_size vs
	  initialized_size vs data_size (i.e. i_size). Done are
	  mft.c::ntfs_mft_readpage(), aops.c::end_buffer_read_index_async(),
	  and attrib.c::load_attribute_list().
	- Lock the run list in attrib.c::load_attribute_list() while using it.
	- Fix memory leak in ntfs_file_read_compressed_block() and generally
	  clean up compress.c a little, removing some uncommented/unused debug
	  code.
	- Tidy up dir.c a little bit.
	- Don't bother getting the run list in inode.c::ntfs_read_inode().
	- Merge mft.c::ntfs_mft_readpage() and aops.c::ntfs_index_readpage()
	  creating aops.c::ntfs_mst_readpage(), improving the handling of
	  holes and overflow in the process and implementing the correct
	  equivalent of ntfs_file_get_block() in ntfs_mst_readpage() itself.
	  I am aiming for correctness at the moment. Modularisation can come
	  later.
	- Rename aops.c::end_buffer_read_index_async() to
	  end_buffer_read_mst_async() and optimize the overflow checking and
	  handling.
	- Use the host of the mftbmp address space mapping to hold the ntfs
	  volume. This is needed so the async i/o completion handler can
	  retrieve a pointer to the volume. Hopefully this will not cause
	  problems elsewhere in the kernel... Otherwise will need to use a
	  fake inode.
	- Complete implementation of proper handling of allocated_size vs
	  initialized_size vs data_size (i.e. i_size) in whole driver.
	  Basically aops.c is now completely rewritten.
	- Change NTFS driver name to just NTFS and set version number to 2.0.0
	  to make a clear distinction from the old driver which is still on
	  version 1.1.22.

tng-0.0.8 - 08/03/2002 - Now using BitKeeper, http://linux-ntfs.bkbits.net/

	- Replace bdevname(sb->s_dev) with sb->s_id.
	- Remove now superfluous new-line characters in all callers of
	  ntfs_debug().
	- Apply kludge in ntfs_read_inode(), setting i_nlink to 1 for
	  directories. Without this the "find" utility gets very upset which is
	  fair enough as Linux/Unix do not support directory hard links.
	- Further run list merging work. (Richard Russon)
	- Backwards compatibility for gcc-2.95. (Richard Russon)
	- Update to kernel 2.5.5-pre1 and rediff the now tiny patch.
	- Convert to new file system declaration using ->ntfs_get_sb() and
	  replacing ntfs_read_super() with ntfs_fill_super().
	- Set s_maxbytes to MAX_LFS_FILESIZE to avoid page cache page index
	  overflow on 32-bit architectures.
	- Cleanup upcase loading code to use ntfs_(un)map_page().
	- Disable/reenable preemtion in critical sections of compession engine.
	- Replace device size determination in ntfs_fill_super() with
	  sb->s_bdev->bd_inode->i_size (in bytes) and remove now superfluous
	  function super.c::get_nr_blocks().
	- Implement a mount time option (show_inodes) allowing choice of which
	  types of inode names readdir() returns and modify ntfs_filldir()
	  accordingly. There are several parameters to show_inodes:
		system:	system files
	  	win32:	long file names (including POSIX file names) [DEFAULT]
		long:	same as win32
	  	dos:	short file names only (excluding POSIX file names)
		short:	same as dos
		posix:	same as both win32 and dos
	  	all:	all file names
	  Note that the options are additive, i.e. specifying:
		-o show_inodes=system,show_inodes=win32,show_inodes=dos
	  is the same as specifying:
		-o show_inodes=all
	  Note that the "posix" and "all" options will show all directory
	  names, BUT the link count on each directory inode entry is set to 1,
	  due to Linux not supporting directory hard links. This may well
	  confuse some userspace applications, since the directory names will
	  have the same inode numbers. Thus it is NOT advisable to use the
	  "posix" or "all" options. We provide them only for completeness sake.
	- Add copies of allocated_size, initialized_size, and compressed_size to
	  the ntfs inode structure and set them up in
	  inode.c::ntfs_read_inode(). These reflect the unnamed data attribute
	  for files and the index allocation attribute for directories.
	- Add copies of allocated_size and initialized_size to ntfs inode for
	  $BITMAP attribute of large directories and set them up in
	  inode.c::ntfs_read_inode().
	- Add copies of allocated_size and initialized_size to ntfs volume for
	  $BITMAP attribute of $MFT and set them up in
	  super.c::load_system_files().
	- Parse deprecated ntfs driver options (iocharset, show_sys_files,
	  posix, and utf8) and tell user what the new options to use are. Note
	  we still do support them but they will be removed with kernel 2.7.x.
	- Change all occurences of integer long long printf formatting to hex
	  as printk() will not support long long integer format if/when the
	  div64 patch goes into the kernel.
	- Make slab caches have stable names and change the names to what they
	  were intended to be. These changes are required/made possible by the
	  new slab cache name handling which removes the length limitation by
	  requiring the caller of kmem_cache_create() to supply a stable name
	  which is then referenced but not copied.
	- Rename run_list structure to run_list_element and create a new
	  run_list structure containing a pointer to a run_list_element
	  structure and a read/write semaphore. Adapt all users of run lists
	  to new scheme and take and release the lock as needed. This fixes a
	  nasty race as the run_list changes even when inodes are locked for
	  reading and even when the inode isn't locked at all, so we really
	  needed the serialization. We use a semaphore rather than a spinlock
	  as memory allocations can sleep and doing everything GFP_ATOMIC
	  would be silly.
	- Cleanup read_inode() removing all code checking for lowest_vcn != 0.
	  This can never happen due to the nature of lookup_attr() and how we
	  support attribute lists. If it did happen it would imply the inode
	  being corrupt.
	- Check for lowest_vcn != 0 in ntfs_read_inode() and mark the inode as
	  bad if found.
	- Update to 2.5.6-pre2 changes in struct address_space.
	- Use parent_ino() when accessing d_parent inode number in dir.c.
	- Import Sourceforge CVS repository into BitKeeper repository:
		http://linux-ntfs.bkbits.net/ntfs-tng-2.5
	- Update fs/Makefile, fs/Config.help, fs/Config.in, and
	  Documentation/filesystems/ntfs.txt for NTFS TNG.
	- Create kernel configuration option controlling whether debugging
	  is enabled or not.
	- Add the required export of end_buffer_io_sync() from the patches
	  directory to the kernel code.
	- Update inode.c::ntfs_show_options() with show_inodes mount option.
	- Update errors mount option.

tng-0.0.7 - 13/02/2002 - The driver is now feature complete for read-only!

	- Cleanup mft.c and it's debug/error output in particular. Fix a minor
	  bug in mapping of extent inodes. Update all the comments to fit all
	  the recent code changes.
	- Modify vcn_to_lcn() to cope with entirely unmapped run lists.
	- Cleanups in compress.c, mostly comments and folding help.
	- Implement attrib.c::map_run_list() as a generic helper.
	- Make compress.c::ntfs_file_read_compressed_block() use map_run_list()
	  thus making code shorter and enabling attribute list support.
	- Cleanup incorrect use of [su]64 with %L printf format specifier in
	  all source files. Type casts to [unsigned] long long added to correct
	  the mismatches (important for architectures which have long long not
	  being 64 bits).
	- Merge async io completion handlers for directory indexes and $MFT
	  data into one by setting the index_block_size{_bits} of the ntfs
	  inode for $MFT to the mft_record_size{_bits} of the ntfs_volume.
	- Cleanup aops.c, update comments.
	- Make ntfs_file_get_block() use map_run_list() so all files now
	  support attribute lists.
	- Make ntfs_dir_readpage() almost verbatim copy of
	  block_read_full_page() by using ntfs_file_get_block() with only real
	  difference being the use of our own async io completion handler
	  rather than the default one, thus reducing the amount of code and
	  automatically enabling attribute list support for directory indices.
	- Fix bug in load_attribute_list() - forgot to call brelse in error
	  code path.
	- Change parameters to find_attr() and lookup_attr(). We no longer
	  pass in the upcase table and its length. These can be gotten from
	  ctx->ntfs_ino->vol->upcase{_len}. Update all callers.
	- Cleanups in attrib.c. 
	- Implement merging of run lists, attrib.c::merge_run_lists() and its
	  helpers. (Richard Russon)
	- Attribute lists part 2, attribute extents and multi part run lists:
	  enable proper support for LCN_RL_NOT_MAPPED and automatic mapping of
	  further run list parts via attrib.c::map_run_list().
	- Tiny endianness bug fix in decompress_mapping_pairs().

tng-0.0.6 - Encrypted directories, bug fixes, cleanups, debugging enhancements.

	- Enable encrypted directories. (Their index root is marked encrypted
	  to indicate that new files in that directory should be created
	  encrypted.)
	- Fix bug in NInoBmpNonResident() macro. (Cut and paste error.)
	- Enable $Extend system directory. Most (if not all) extended system
	  files do not have unnamed data attributes so ntfs_read_inode() had to
	  special case them but that is ok, as the special casing recovery
	  happens inside an error code path so there is zero slow down in the
	  normal fast path. The special casing is done by introducing a new
	  function inode.c::ntfs_is_extended_system_file() which checks if any
	  of the hard links in the inode point to $Extend as being their parent
	  directory and if they do we assume this is an extended system file.
	- Create a sysctl/proc interface to allow {dis,en}abling of debug output
	  when compiled with -DDEBUG. Default is debug messages to be disabled.
	  To enable them, one writes a non-zero value to /proc/sys/fs/ntfs-debug
	  (if /proc is enabled) or uses sysctl(2) to effect the same (if sysctl
	  interface is enabled). Inspired by old ntfs driver.
	- Add debug_msgs insmod/kernel boot parameter to set whether debug
	  messages are {dis,en}abled. This is useful to enable debug messages
	  during ntfs initialization and is the only way to activate debugging
	  when the sysctl interface is not enabled.
	- Cleanup debug output in various places.
	- Remove all dollar signs ($) from the source (except comments) to
	  enable compilation on architectures whose gcc compiler does not
	  support dollar signs in the names of variables/constants. Attribute
	  types now start with AT_ instead of $ and $I30 is now just I30.
	- Cleanup ntfs_lookup() and add consistency check of sequence numbers.
	- Load complete run list for $MFT/$BITMAP during mount and cleanup
	  access functions. This means we now cope with $MFT/$BITMAP being
	  spread accross several mft records.
	- Disable modification of mft_zone_multiplier on remount. We can always
	  reenable this later on if we really want to, but we will need to make
	  sure we readjust the mft_zone size / layout accordingly.

tng-0.0.5 - Modernize for 2.5.x and further in line-ing with Al Viro's comments.

	- Use sb_set_blocksize() instead of set_blocksize() and verify the
	  return value.
	- Use sb_bread() instead of bread() throughout.
	- Add index_vcn_size{_bits} to ntfs_inode structure to store the size
	  of a directory index block vcn. Apply resulting simplifications in
	  dir.c everywhere.
	- Fix a small bug somewhere (but forgot what it was).
	- Change ntfs_{debug,error,warning} to enable gcc to do type checking
	  on the printf-format parameter list and fix bugs reported by gcc
	  as a result. (Richard Russon)
	- Move inode allocation strategy to Al's new stuff but maintain the
	  divorce of ntfs_inode from struct inode. To achieve this we have two
	  separate slab caches, one for big ntfs inodes containing a struct
	  inode and pure ntfs inodes and at the same time fix some faulty
	  error code paths in ntfs_read_inode().
	- Show mount options in proc (inode.c::ntfs_show_options()).

tng-0.0.4 - Big changes, getting in line with Al Viro's comments.

	- Modified (un)map_mft_record functions to be common for read and write
	  case. To specify which is which, added extra parameter at front of
	  parameter list. Pass either READ or WRITE to this, each has the
	  obvious meaning.
	- General cleanups to allow for easier folding in vi.
	- attrib.c::decompress_mapping_pairs() now accepts the old run list
	  argument, and invokes attrib.c::merge_run_lists() to merge the old
	  and the new run lists.
	- Removed attrib.c::find_first_attr().
	- Implemented loading of attribute list and complete run list for $MFT.
	  This means we now cope with $MFT being spread across several mft
	  records.
	- Adapt to 2.5.2-pre9 and the changed create_empty_buffers() syntax.
	- Adapt major/minor/kdev_t/[bk]devname stuff to new 2.5.x kernels.
	- Make ntfs_volume be allocated via kmalloc() instead of using a slab
	  cache. There are too little ntfs_volume structures at any one time
	  to justify a private slab cache.
	- Fix bogus kmap() use in async io completion. Now use kmap_atomic().
	  Use KM_BIO_IRQ on advice from IRC/kernel...
	- Use ntfs_map_page() in map_mft_record() and create ->readpage method
	  for reading $MFT (ntfs_mft_readpage). In the process create dedicated
	  address space operations (ntfs_mft_aops) for $MFT inode mapping. Also
	  removed the now superfluous exports from the kernel core patch.
	- Fix a bug where kfree() was used insted of ntfs_free().
	- Change map_mft_record() to take ntfs_inode as argument instead of
	  vfs inode. Dito for unmap_mft_record(). Adapt all callers.
	- Add pointer to ntfs_volume to ntfs_inode.
	- Add mft record number and sequence number to ntfs_inode. Stop using
	  i_ino and i_generation for in-driver purposes.
	- Implement attrib.c::merge_run_lists(). (Richard Russon)
	- Remove use of proper inodes by extent inodes. Move i_ino and
	  i_generation to ntfs_inode to do this. Apply simplifications that
	  result and remove iget_no_wait(), etc.
	- Pass ntfs_inode everywhere in the driver (used to be struct inode).
	- Add reference counting in ntfs_inode for the ntfs inode itself and
	  for the mapped mft record.
	- Extend mft record mapping so we can (un)map extent mft records (new
	  functions (un)map_extent_mft_record), and so mappings are reference
	  counted and don't have to happen twice if already mapped - just ref
	  count increases.
	- Add -o iocharset as alias to -o nls for backwards compatibility.
	- The latest core patch is now tiny. In fact just a single additional
	  export is necessary over the base kernel.

tng-0.0.3 - Cleanups, enhancements, bug fixes.

	- Work on attrib.c::decompress_mapping_pairs() to detect base extents
	  and setup the run list appropriately using knowledge provided by the
	  sizes in the base attribute record.
	- Balance the get_/put_attr_search_ctx() calls so we don't leak memory
	  any more.
	- Introduce ntfs_malloc_nofs() and ntfs_free() to allocate/free a single
	  page or use vmalloc depending on the amount of memory requested.
	- Cleanup error output. The __FUNCTION__ "(): " is now added
	  automatically. Introduced a new header file debug.h to support this
	  and also moved ntfs_debug() function into it.
	- Make reading of compressed files more intelligent and especially get
	  rid of the vmalloc_nofs() from readpage(). This now uses per CPU
	  buffers (allocated at first mount with cluster size <= 4kiB and
	  deallocated on last umount with cluster size <= 4kiB), and
	  asynchronous io for the compressed data using a list of buffer heads.
	  Er, we use synchronous io as async io only works on whole pages
	  covered by buffers and not on individual buffer heads...
	- Bug fix for reading compressed files with sparse compression blocks.

tng-0.0.2 - Now handles larger/fragmented/compressed volumes/files/dirs.

	- Fixed handling of directories when cluster size exceeds index block
	  size.
	- Hide DOS only name space directory entries from readdir() but allow
	  them in lookup(). This should fix the problem that Linux doesn't
	  support directory hard links, while still allowing access to entries
	  via their short file name. This also has the benefit of mimicking
	  what Windows users are used to, so it is the ideal solution.
	- Implemented sync_page everywhere so no more hangs in D state when
	  waiting for a page.
	- Stop using bforget() in favour of brelse().
	- Stop locking buffers unnecessarily.
	- Implemented compressed files (inode->mapping contains uncompressed
	  data, raw compressed data is currently bread() into a vmalloc()ed
	  memory buffer).
	- Enable compressed directories. (Their index root is marked compressed
	  to indicate that new files in that directory should be created
	  compressed.)
	- Use vsnprintf rather than vsprintf in the ntfs_error and ntfs_warning
	  functions. (Thanks to Will Dyson for pointing this out.)
	- Moved the ntfs_inode and ntfs_volume (the former ntfs_inode_info and
	  ntfs_sb_info) out of the common inode and super_block structures and
	  started using the generic_ip and generic_sbp pointers instead. This
	  makes ntfs entirely private with respect to the kernel tree.
	- Detect compiler version and abort with error message if gcc less than
	  2.96 is used.
	- Fix bug in name comparison function in unistr.c.
	- Implement attribute lists part 1, the infrastructure: search contexts
	  and operations, find_external_attr(), lookup_attr()) and make the
	  code use the infrastructure.
	- Fix stupid buffer overflow bug that became apparent on larger run
	  list containing attributes.
	- Fix bugs in readdir() that became apparent on larger directories.

	The driver is now really useful and survives the test
		find . -type f -exec md5sum "{}" \;
	without any error messages on a over 1GiB sized partition with >16k
	files on it, including compressed files and directories and many files
	and directories with attribute lists.

tng-0.0.1 - The first useful version.

	- Added ntfs_lookup().
	- Added default upcase generation and handling.
	- Added compile options to be shown on module init.
	- Many bug fixes that were "hidden" before.
	- Update to latest kernel.
	- Added ntfs_readdir().
	- Added file operations for mmap(), read(), open() and llseek(). We just
	  use the generic ones. The whole point of going through implementing
	  readpage() methods and where possible get_block() call backs is that
	  this allows us to make use of the generic high level methods provided
	  by the kernel.

	The driver is now actually useful! Yey. (-: It undoubtedly has got bugs
	though and it doesn't implement accesssing compressed files yet. Also,
	accessing files with attribute list attributes is not implemented yet
	either. But for small or simple file systems it should work and allow
	you to list directories, use stat on directory entries and the file
	system, open, read, mmap and llseek around in files. A big mile stone
	has been reached!

tng-0.0.0 - Initial version tag.

	Initial driver implementation. The driver can mount and umount simple
	NTFS file systems (i.e. ones without attribute lists in the system
	files). If the mount fails there might be problems in the error handling
	code paths, so be warned. Otherwise it seems to be loading the system
	files nicely and the mft record read mapping/unmapping seems to be
	working nicely, too. Proof of inode metadata in the page cache and non-
	resident file unnamed stream data in the page cache concepts is thus
	complete.
