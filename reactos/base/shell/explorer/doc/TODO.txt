> The nits:
> * the MDI file manager top window does not seem to be aware of the scroll-wheel
> * the task bar clock color seems to be hard-coded, and so does not show
>   with the High Contrast color. Several other places have similar issues
> * there's no quick launch
> * the desktop lacks much functionality, including the ability to arrange icons
> * there are no startmenu settings/it does not heed the MS explorer ones

> Is there some means of transferring applications across desktops?
> What about (configurable) key combos to cycle/change desktops?
