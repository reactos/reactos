.SH NAME
pdftops \- Portable Document Format (PDF) to PostScript converter
(version 3.00)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pdftops
[options]
.RI [ PDF-file
.RI [ PS-file ]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Pdftops
converts Portable Document Format (PDF) files to PostScript so they
can be printed.
.PP
Pdftops reads the PDF file,
.IR PDF-file ,
and writes a PostScript file,
.IR PS-file .
If
.I PS-file
is not specified, pdftops converts
.I file.pdf
to
.I file.ps
(or
.I file.eps
with the -eps option).  If 
.I PS-file
is \'-', the PostScript is sent to stdout.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
Pdftops reads a configuration file at startup.  It first tries to find
the user's private config file, ~/.xpdfrc.  If that doesn't exist, it
looks for a system-wide config file, /etc/xpdf/xpdfrc.  See the
.BR xpdfrc (5)
man page for details.
.SH OPTIONS
Many of the following options can be set with configuration file
commands.  These are listed in square brackets with the description of
the corresponding command line option.
.TP
.BI \-f " number"
Specifies the first page to print.
.TP
.BI \-l " number"
Specifies the last page to print.
.TP
.B \-level1
Generate Level 1 PostScript.  The resulting PostScript files will be
significantly larger (if they contain images), but will print on Level
1 printers.  This also converts all images to black and white.  No
more than one of the PostScript level options (-level1, -level1sep,
-level2, -level2sep, -level3, -level3Sep) may be given.
.RB "[config file: " psLevel ]
.TP
.B \-level1sep
Generate Level 1 separable PostScript.  All colors are converted to
CMYK.  Images are written with separate stream data for the four
components.
.RB "[config file: " psLevel ]
.TP
.B \-level2
Generate Level 2 PostScript.  Level 2 supports color images and image
compression.  This is the default setting.
.RB "[config file: " psLevel ]
.TP
.B \-level2sep
Generate Level 2 separable PostScript.  All colors are converted to
CMYK.  The PostScript separation convention operators are used to
handle custom (spot) colors.
.RB "[config file: " psLevel ]
.TP
.B \-level3
Generate Level 3 PostScript.  This enables all Level 2 features plus
CID font embedding.
.RB "[config file: " psLevel ]
.TP
.B \-level3Sep
Generate Level 3 separable PostScript.  The separation handling is the
same as for -level2Sep.
.RB "[config file: " psLevel ]
.TP
.B \-eps
Generate an Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file.  An EPS file contains
a single image, so if you use this option with a multi-page PDF file,
you must use -f and -l to specify a single page.  No more than one of
the mode options (-eps, -form) may be given.
.TP
.B \-form
Generate a PostScript form which can be imported by software that
understands forms.  A form contains a single page, so if you use this
option with a multi-page PDF file, you must use -f and -l to specify a
single page.  The -level1 option cannot be used with -form.
.TP
.B \-opi
Generate OPI comments for all images and forms which have OPI
information.  (This option is only available if pdftops was compiled
with OPI support.)
.RB "[config file: " psOPI ]
.TP
.B \-noembt1
By default, any Type 1 fonts which are embedded in the PDF file are
copied into the PostScript file.  This option causes pdftops to
substitute base fonts instead.  Embedded fonts make PostScript files
larger, but may be necessary for readable output.
.RB "[config file: " psEmbedType1Fonts ]
.TP
.B \-noembtt
By default, any TrueType fonts which are embedded in the PDF file are
copied into the PostScript file.  This option causes pdftops to
substitute base fonts instead.  Embedded fonts make PostScript files
larger, but may be necessary for readable output.  Also, some
PostScript interpreters do not have TrueType rasterizers.
.RB "[config file: " psEmbedTrueTypeFonts ]
.TP
.B \-noembcidps
By default, any CID PostScript fonts which are embedded in the PDF
file are copied into the PostScript file.  This option disables that
embedding.  No attempt is made to substitute for non-embedded CID
PostScript fonts.
.RB "[config file: " psEmbedCIDPostScriptFonts ]
.TP
.B \-noembcidtt
By default, any CID TrueType fonts which are embedded in the PDF file
are copied into the PostScript file.  This option disables that
embedding.  No attempt is made to substitute for non-embedded CID
TrueType fonts.
.RB "[config file: " psEmbedCIDTrueTypeFonts ]
.TP
.BI \-paper " size"
Set the paper size to one of "letter", "legal", "A4", or "A3".  This
can also be set to "match", which will set the paper size to match the
size specified in the PDF file.
.RB "[config file: " psPaperSize ]
.TP
.BI \-paperw " size"
Set the paper width, in points.
.RB "[config file: " psPaperSize ]
.TP
.BI \-paperh " size"
Set the paper height, in points.
.RB "[config file: " psPaperSize ]
.TP
.B \-nocrop
By default, output is cropped to the CropBox specified in the PDF
file.  This option disables cropping.
.RB "[config file: " psCrop ]
.TP
.B \-expand
Expand PDF pages smaller than the paper to fill the paper.  By
default, these pages are not scaled.
.RB "[config file: " psExpandSmaller ]
.TP
.B \-noshrink
Don't scale PDF pages which are larger than the paper.  By default,
pages larger than the paper are shrunk to fit.
.RB "[config file: " psShrinkLarger ]
.TP
.B \-nocenter
By default, PDF pages smaller than the paper (after any scaling) are
centered on the paper.  This option causes them to be aligned to the
lower-left corner of the paper instead.
.RB "[config file: " psCenter ]
.TP
.B \-duplex
Set the Duplex pagedevice entry in the PostScript file.  This tells
duplex-capable printers to enable duplexing.
.RB "[config file: " psDuplex ]
.TP
.BI \-opw " password"
Specify the owner password for the PDF file.  Providing this will
bypass all security restrictions.
.TP
.BI \-upw " password"
Specify the user password for the PDF file.
.TP
.B \-q
Don't print any messages or errors.
.RB "[config file: " errQuiet ]
.TP
.BI \-cfg " config-file"
Read
.I config-file
in place of ~/.xpdfrc or the system-wide config file.
.TP
.B \-v
Print copyright and version information.
.TP
.B \-h
Print usage information.
.RB ( \-help
and
.B \-\-help
are equivalent.)
