; ------------------------ MEMOPAD.TXT ---------------------
;
; This is the help text file for the MEMOPAD application. It 
; includes the help text that a D-Flat application would use 
; for the user interface.
;
; There can be a help window with a helptag name for each
; command in commands.h, each menu label on the menu bar 
; as defined in menus.c, and each dialog box name in dialogs.c
;
; There can be other help windows as well. Some of them will
; be displayed as the result of hypertext and definition key 
; words embedded in the help text of other help windows. Others
; can be implemented from within an application software system.
;
; Following is the format for a help window:
;
; ÚÄÄ (1st column of each line)
; 
; ; anything with a semicolon in the 1st column is a comment
; <helptag>                 (names the help window)
; [<<]<helptag>             (names the previous window in chain)
; [>>]<helptag>             (names the next window in chain)
; Help Window Title         (displays in window's title bar)
; Help text follows until next helptag occurs
; Hypertext reference  [..keyword]<helptag> embedded in text
; Definition reference [**keyword]<helptag> embedded in text
; <helptag>                 (names another window)
;
; Notes: 
;   1. A hypertext reference, when selected, causes the 
;      associated help window named by the <helptag> to 
;      become the active help window.
;   2. A definition reference, when selected, displays
;      a momentary window with the text of the associated
;      help window named by the <helptag>. The window 
;      closes when the user releases the Enter key or
;      mouse button.
;   3. A definition window has no title.
;   4. The last window is followed by the <end> helptag.
;   5. The window's height and width adjust to the text.
;   6. The [..], [**], and <helptags> do not display and
;      do not figure in the width of the line in which 
;      they occur.

highlighted the same as references. When you select
the definition, a window displays in the upper left
corner of the desktop. The window contains the
definition of the selected term and stays in view
until you release the Enter key or the mouse
button.

Command Buttons on the Help Windows
-----------------------------------
Each help window contains these [..command buttons]<cmdbuttons>:

         exits from the help system.
  Back   This button changes to the help window
         that you viewed before the current one.
  Prev   This button changes to the help window
         that logically preceeds the current one.

Extended Help
The MEMOPAD program has few features and procedures
that are not taken directly from the SAA/CUA
interface that D-Flat implements. The [..Log Messages]<ID_LOG>
and [..Display]<ID_DISPLAY> selections on the [..Options]<Options> menu are
unique to MEMOPAD and would not necessarily be in
an application. Some of the Display features would
be useful to a user who is not developing D-Flat
programs. Others, such as the [..Title]<ID_TITLE>, [..Border]<ID_BORDER>,
[..Status Bar]<ID_STATUSBAR>, and [..Texture]<ID_TEXTURE> check boxes on the [..Display]<Display>
dialog box, are to allow a programmer to see how
the screen looks with these features enabled and
disabled.
