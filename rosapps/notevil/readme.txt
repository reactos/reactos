ReactOS Coders Console Parade
-----------------------------

The name "notevil" is from the well known Easter egg
of the "3D Text (OpenGL)" screen saver, which
displays the NT programmers' names if one writes
"not evil" in the text box.

To add a new name, add a new string in the
contributors.rbuild file

Eventually run make.

Written to test Win32 console functions implementation.
