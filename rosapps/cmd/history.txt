o  added MD command.
o  added RD command.
o  added VER command.

12/10/95 version 0.30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

o  fixed a bug in history.c that made it not work when you hit the up arrow
   on the first line

01/06/96 version 0.40  (never released)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
o  added redirection and piping support!!!  (see redir.c and command.c)

   (e.g. DIR only pauses if you're not doing redirection)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version 0.40 was never released because I was home on Christmas vacation,
and I couldn't upload it.  By the time I got back to school, I had the
LOADHIGH patch from Svante Frey, so I decided to jump up to 0.50 without any
release of 0.40...       - Tim Norman
