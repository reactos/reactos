Things to do
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fix bugs :)

Optimize the code!  For size and speed.  There are numerous places
where the code is hardly optimal for either.

Sorting in DIR command ("dir /o...").

^S and ^Q to pause/resume displays.

Improve DEL, COPY and MOVE commands.
BREAK command on command-line.

Add wildcard support to REN.

And many, many more...
