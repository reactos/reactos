Protocol overview
=================

The lspci virtual channel makes it possible for the remote RDP server
to enumerate the local PCI devices. The protocol on this channel is
text based and line oriented: One single line per request or
response. UNIX-style LF line breaks are used. The maximum line length
is 1023, newline included.

rdesktop acts as a server, with only one request:

    LSPCI

The response is several lines with this syntax:

<class>,<vendor>,<device>,<subvendor>,<subdevice>,<revision>,<progif>

After the last line, a line with a single dot is sent. 

Example:

0300,102b,0525,102b,0338,04,00
0401,8086,24d5,1028,0174,02,8f
.


Usage
=====

To enable to lspci virtual channel, run rdesktop with "-r lspci".
