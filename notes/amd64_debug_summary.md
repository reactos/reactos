# ReactOS AMD64 Boot Issues - Summary

## Current Boot Progress
ReactOS AMD64 boots through the bootloader and kernel initialization but fails at IO1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED (0x69) due to no storage devices being detected.

## Root Cause
The Intel PIIX3 IDE controller at PCI slot 0x21 is detected at the hardware level, but no IDE drivers are being loaded to handle it. This is a critical boot driver loading issue.

## Key Findings

### 1. PCI Hardware Access Working
- PCI slot 0x21 (Device 1, Function 1) is accessible
- Device correctly identified as Intel PIIX3 IDE (VendorID=0x8086, DeviceID=0x7010)
- PCI class codes correct: BaseClass=0x01, SubClass=0x01, ProgIf=0x80

### 2. Driver Loading Issue
- BusLogic SCSI driver loads but fails (device not present - expected)
- PCI bus driver (pci.sys) not loading
- IDE drivers (pciide.sys, pciidex.sys, atapi.sys) not loading
- Without these drivers, no storage devices are detected

### 3. Boot Driver Configuration
The issue is in the boot-critical driver loading:
- Drivers marked with 'x' flag in txtsetup.sif are loaded at boot
- Added 'x' flag to pciide.sys, pciidex.sys, atapi.sys
- Added registry entries for these drivers in hivesys.inf
- Still not loading - suggests bootloader issue on AMD64

## Files Modified
1. `/hal/halx86/legacy/bus/pcibus.c` - Added debugging for PCI access
2. `/boot/bootdata/hivesys.inf` - Added registry entries for IDE/PCI drivers
3. `/boot/bootdata/txtsetup.sif` - Marked IDE drivers as boot-critical

## Next Steps
1. Investigate why bootloader isn't loading marked boot drivers on AMD64
2. Check if there's an AMD64-specific driver loading path
3. Compare bootloader behavior between i386 (working) and AMD64
4. May need to modify bootloader to explicitly load IDE drivers on AMD64

## Working Hypothesis
The bootloader on AMD64 has a different or broken boot driver loading mechanism compared to i386. The drivers are correctly configured but not being loaded during the boot phase, preventing storage initialization.
