Quick start.

  GNU Make (Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, CygWin, etc.), with gcc:

    make -f gcc.mak depend
    make -f gcc.mak install

  GNU Make (SunOS), with SunPro CC:

    make -f CC.mak depend
    make -f CC.mak install

  Microsoft NMAKE (MS Windows), with VC6:

    nmake /fmsvc.mak install


Make system goals.

  - all source files declared in one place (for all platforms and
    compilers); the same is for base library (application) name and
    version.
  - derive object filenames from source filenames in make system
  - source files may be situated in few catalogs
  - avoid information duplication, if possible
  - support cross-compilation


Make targets.

  release-static

    build STLport as static library

  dbg-static

    build STLport as static library (with debug information)

  stldbg-static

    build STLport as static library (STLP_DEBUG mode, with debug information)

  release-shared

    build STLport as dynamic (shared) library

  dbg-shared

    STLport as dynamic (shared) library (with debug information)

  stldbg-shared

    build STLport as dynamic (shared) library (STLP_DEBUG mode, with
    debug information)

  all (default)

     cumulative target for release,dbg,stldbg -shared on Unix-lile platforms
     and plus release,dbg,stldbg -static on Windows.

  depend

    create dependency files (for performance reasons dependency not created
    during compilation process); this target absent for MS NMAKE (due to pure
    scripting opportunities)

  install-release-shared
  install-dbg-shared
  install-stldbg-shared
  install-release-static
  install-dbg-static
  install-stldbg-static

    build and install appropriate libraries and related files, into
    'STLport/lib' and 'STLport/bin' (../../lib, relative position of this file)

  install

    cumulative target for install-*-shared on Unix-like platforms and
    install-*-* on Windows.

  clean

    remove all intermediate files
