==================================================
STLport README for Digital Mars C++ compilers.
==================================================

Build of STLport with Digital Mars C++ compiler is very similar
to the one for Microsoft Visual Studio compiler (see README.msvc).

Below are some additional hints. [DMC users are encouraged to 
contribute additional information.] 

=============
Prerequisites
=============

 - Digital Mars C++ 8.49 or above

 - A GNU environment with make tool. Prefer MinGW/MSys to Cygwin because the
   latter contains a link command that is also the name of the Digital Mars linker
   and you might experiment collision between both commands.
   See README.mingw for additional information.

===================
Installing STLport
===================

 - STLport directory can be almost anywhere EXCEPT native dm\include directory.

===================
Configuring STLport
===================

 - In a console window go to the STLport build\lib folder. Run

	  configure -c dmc

================
Building STLport
================

 - To build STLport libraries:

    cd [STLport dir]\build\lib
    [mingw32-make] -f dmc.mak install

 - To build STLport (dynamic) unit tests:

    cd [STLport dir]\build\test\unit
    [mingw32-make] -f dmc.mak install

============
Known issues
============

1. typeinfo.h

  DMC forces inclusion of typeinfo.h header at the begining of any
translation unit. This breaks the STLport include schema, especially
when building the library. As a workaround STLport typeinfo.h simply
include native DMC header not performing any internal STLport work as
importing things to STLport namespace. As a result typeinfo.h should
never be reference in user code, as it is neither a C nor a C++ header
this is not considered as a major limitation. The C++ Standard header
is typeinfo.

2. link.exe and lib.exe

  STLport makefiles for DMC use dm_link and dm_lib instead of link and lib to
avoid conflicts with other vendors' linkers and archivers.  To build STLport 
with DMC, please copy or rename the following files:
  
  copy dm\bin\link.exe dm\bin\dm_link.exe
  copy dm\bin\lib.exe dm\bin\dm_lib.exe

3. Free online version. 

  If DMC's free online version reports compiler or linker errors, the 
solution may be in a free online CD update.  Download and unzip all free 
CD patches for versions 8.30 and above, in consecutive order, overwriting
previous files. Then install free online version 8.49 or above, overwriting 
previous files.
