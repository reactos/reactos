<p>

adns is a resolver library for C (and C++) programs, and a collection
of useful DNS resolver utilities.


<h2>C library</h2>

In contrast with the standard interfaces, gethostbyname et al and
libresolv, it has the following features:

<ul>

<li>It is reasonably easy to use for simple programs which just want
to translate names to addresses, look up MX records, etc.

<li>It can be used in an asynchronous, non-blocking, manner.  Many
queries can be handled simultaneously.

<li>Responses are decoded automatically into a natural representation
for a C program - there is no need to deal with DNS packet formats.

<li>Sanity checking (eg, name syntax checking, reverse/forward
correspondence, CNAME pointing to CNAME) is performed automatically.

<li>Time-to-live, CNAME and other similar information is returned in
an easy-to-use form, without getting in the way.

<li>There is no global state in the library; resolver state is an
opaque data structure which the client creates explicitly.  A program
can have several instances of the resolver.

<li>Errors are reported to the application in a way that distinguishes
the various causes of failure properly.

<li>Understands conventional resolv.conf, but this can overridden by
environment variables.

<li>Flexibility.  For example, the application can tell adns to:
ignore environment variables (for setuid programs), disable hostname
syntax sanity checks to return arbitrary data, override or ignore
resolv.conf in favour of supplied configuration, etc.

<li>Believed to be correct !  For example, will correctly back off to
TCP in case of long replies or queries, or to other nameservers if
several are available.  It has sensible handling of bad responses etc.

</ul>

<h2>DNS utility programs</h2>

adns also comes with a number of utility programs for use from the
command line and in scripts:

<ul>

<li><code>adnslogres</code> is a much faster version of Apache's
logresolv program.

<li><code>adnsresfilter</code> is a filter which copies its input to
its output, replacing IP addresses by the corresponding names, without
unduly delaying the output.  For example, you can usefully pipe the
output of netstat -n, tcpdump -ln, and the like, into it.

<li><code>adnshost</code> is a general-purpose DNS lookup utility
which can be used easily in from the command line and from shell
scripts to do simple lookups.  In a more advanced mode it can be used
as a general-purpose DNS helper program for scripting languages which
can invoke and communicate with subprocesses.  See the
<A href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/adns/adnshost.txt">adnshost
usage message</A> for a summary of its capabilities.

</ul>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

I'm afraid there is no manual yet.  However, competent C programmers
should be able to use the library based on the
<A href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/adns/adns.h.txt">commented
adns.h header file</A>, and the usage messages for the programs should
be sufficient.

<h2>Feedback</h2>

I'd be pleased if you would let me know if you're using my library in
your project, and what you think of it.

<h2>Download</h2>

Available for download from
<A href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/adns/">chiark.greenend.org.uk</A>
are:
<ul>
<li>The <A href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/adns/adns.tar.gz">current
    release</A> as a gzipped tarfile.
<li><A href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/adns/adns.h.txt">adns.h</A>
    API header file with comments, and

    message for adnshost</A> (currently there is no manual, sorry).
<li>All versions released so far are also available via
    <A href="ftp://ftp.chiark.greenend.org.uk/users/ian/adns/">anonymous
    FTP</A> and <A href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/adns/ftp/">HTTP</A>,
<li>A mirror of my CVS repository is available via rsync from
    <code>rsync.chiark.greenend.org.uk::ftp/users/ian/cvs-pub/adns</code>
    (use FTP first to find your way around), or via
    <A href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/ucgi/~ijackson/cvsweb/adns/">cvsweb</A>.
</ul>

adns is also available from the
<A href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU Project</A> FTP servers and their
<A href="http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html">mirrors</A>.

<h2>Technical note</h2>

adns requires a real nameserver like
<A href="http://www.isc.org/view.cgi?/products/BIND/index.phtml">BIND</A>
or
<A href="http://www.dents.org/">Dents</A> running on
the same system or a nearby one, which must be willing to provide
`recursive service'.  I.e., adns is a `stub resolver'.  All properly
configured UN*X and GNU systems will already have such nameserver(s);
they are usually listed in /etc/resolv.conf.
