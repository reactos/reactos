adns (1.0); urgency=medium

  Bugfixes:
  * Treat 8-bit characters in email addrs as RFC822 `special' (=> quote).
  * Fix incorrect `compressed datagram contains loop' error.
  * Actually compile shared libraries by default !
  * Fix adnsresfilter usage message to include correct default timeout.

  General improvements:
  * adnshost, adnslogres, adnsresfilter have options for config override. 
  * adnsresfilter has --debug option.
  * Improvements to adnslogres (incl. new -c option) from Tony Finch.
  * adnslogres has --help option, all utilities support --version.
  * Documentation improved somewhat, including new GPL-vs-LGPL file.

  Changes for non-BETA release:
  * Change shared library soname to 1.0.
  * Do not install adnstest test utility.

  Regression test improvements:
  * Tests now include adnshost, adnslogres and adnsresfilter.
  * Test cancellation both before and after query completion.

  Portability fixes and cleanups:
  * adnstest: setvbuf(stdout,...) before we do first output.
  * Cope with compilers that don't do `inline'.
  * Add and fix various missing system #includes.
  * Find install-sh properly when we need to use it, and chmod it +x.
  * Do not use variadic macro, use stdarg instead (adnslogres.c).
  * Regression tests work even if some syscalls are already macros.
  * #include "config.h" before "adns.h".
  * Cast a sizeof(...) in src/event.c to unsigned long before printing.
  * Add pre-generated versions of m4-generated files in regress/.
  * Kill bogus warning, adh-main.c: `arg2' might be used uninitialized ...
  * Add extra {...} near adnslogres.c:167 to kill spurious warning.
  * Use `printf' instead of `echo -n'.
  * Add list of tested platforms in INSTALL file.

adns (0.9) BETA; urgency=high

  Bug fixes:
  * Don't make _processany always kill the TCP connection with the message
    `TCP connection failed: poll/select: exceptional condition detected'.
  * Call MEM_ROUND in __transfer_interim (avoids assert fail
    `qu->interim_allocd>=0' on some platforms eg 64 bit).
  * adnsresfilter doesn't resolve textual prefixes of addresses (eg,
    10.0.0.1 out of 10.0.0.123) if input happens to block at that point.
  * Do not spin if TCP connection blocks for writing (and add test case).
  * Fail queries if TCP dies repeatedly, rather than retrying many times.
  * Do not abort in a couple of places if TCP unexpectedly broken.
  * Do not free something twice if query fails and is then cancelled.

  Portability/compilation fixes:
  * Move `extern "C" {' to after #include <...>'s.
  * Pass LDFLAGS from configure on to ld via settings.make.in.
  * make clean deletes *.so and *.so.* files.
  * New --disable-dynamic configure option for non-ELF systems.
  * Use AC_PROG_INSTALL (=> perhaps install-sh), to avoid bad `install'.

  Minor improvements:
  * Do not print warning if sendto() gives EAGAIN.
  * adnsresfilter default timeout changed to 1000ms.
  * m1test script can invoke `hrecord' differently.
  * regress/output-<case>.report file contains more useful info.
  * TODO list and other docs updated slightly.
  * Referrals with RD+RA set, or RCODE=Refused, don't generate warnings,
    just debug messages.  BIND does this kind of thing all the time.

adns (0.8) BETA; urgency=medium

  Bugfixes:
  * Race near adns_beforeselect which could cause infinite timeout fixed
    (it's now less agressive, and will more often return a zero timeout.)
  * Fixed infrequent race causing assertion failure in adns__tcp_broken
    `ads->tcpstate == server_connecting || ads->tcpstate == server_ok'.
  * Spurious `server failure on unidentifiable query' warning suppressed.
  * If we get a referral, don't also always complain falsely about RD==0.
  * adnslogres: cast chars to unsigned char before using ctype.h macros.
  * In _beforeselect, global failure now means zero timeout, and in
    tcp_events, really never try to do anything with the TCP connection if
    act is zero.  This might possibly cause an infinite delay (ie, lockup)
    if things go badly wrong *and* a really unlikely race happens.
  * Test suite `lines of syscall left' value is correct; !0 is failure.

  Portability fixes:
  * install-sh (from autoconf 2.12 Debian r13) included.
  * adnslogres: do not call equivalent of printf("%.*s",0,(char*)0).

  Documentation improvements:
  * Security/performance note added, about local nameservers and DNSSEC.
  * Documented that adns_rr_info _rr_hostaddr ( ) for address list
    means permanent failure, and ? means temporary failure.
  * Typo (*now for now in _beforeselect description) in adns.h fixed.
  * Copyright notices updated.
  
  Changes to produce more defensive code:
  * In adns_wait, assert that the timeout is not infinite.
  * Make qu->id start out as -2 when initially allocated.

adns (0.7) BETA; urgency=medium

  * New adns_submit_reverse_any for eg RBL lookups, and corresponding
    option to adnshost.
  * README updated (from www home page).

  * In answers, quote all except alphanums and - _ / + (and document).
  * Don't reject specials in cnames even without adns_qf_quotefail_cname.
  * Better checking of long domain names and labels in queries.
  * answer->owner may be null on error.  Documented, and adnshost copes.
  * Better reporting of unexpected or weird replies from nameserver.
  * Add test case for recursion (infinite loop) domain compression.

 -- Ian Jackson <ian@davenant.greenend.org.uk>  Thu,  2 Mar 2000 01:55:53 +0000

adns (0.6) BETA; urgency=high

  Core library bugfixes:
  * Avoid infinite timeouts, causing lockup, when they should be zero !
  * TCP handling revamped (avoids undefined behaviour due to reentrancy).
  * Do not fail assertion if _qf_owner, _qf_search, domain ends in `.'.
  * Many memory leaks fixed.

  Cool new utility:
  * adnsresfilter is like `cat' but converts addresses to names without
    delaying the output.  Pipe `netstat -n', `tcpdump -ln', etc. into it.

  Test and client program bug and portability fixes:
  * Dynamic library building works properly.
  * adnshost prints somewhat better messages about some wrong usages.
  * Include <stdlib.h> and <sys/types.h> in adnshost.h.
  * adnslogres: parsing and error checking improved (Tony Finch).
  * Regression tests can cope with zero-length reads.
  * Regression tests check for memory leaks.
  * adnstest copes with empty query type list.
  * adnstest uninitialised memory bug fixed.

  General improvements
  * Better control of adnshost output and error messages (new -F options).
  * New adns_if_logpid option (functionality suggested by Tony Finch).
  * New fanftest test program from Tony Finch (ignored by `make install').
  * Reads /etc/resolv-adns.conf if it exists.
  * Declare flags parameters as enums again, not ints.

 -- Ian Jackson <ian@davenant.greenend.org.uk>  Wed, 24 Nov 1999 17:13:03 +0000

adns (0.5) unstable; urgency=high

  New features:
  * adnslogres, ~100x faster replacement for Apache logresolve;
    Thanks to Tony Finch for the program and the performance figure.
  * Internal consistency checking with assert if right options set.
  * adns_wait_poll function like adns_wait but uses poll, not select.
  * adns_reverse_submit function for easy in-addr queries.
  * adns_errtypeabbrev funcion for getting eg "permfail" from _s_nodata.
  * adnshost utility for scripts and the like (rather alpha).

  Incompatible changes:
  * RRs with mailboxes never rejected due to strange chars if _raw.
  * Lack of a mailbox produces `.' not `<>'.
  * Better usage messages (and no default query domain) for adnstest.
  * Return EAGAIN from _check instead of EWOULDBLOCK.
  * adns_rr_info on _r_mx etc. shows status type abbrev and status number.
  
  Bugfixes:
  * Do not invoke __autosys indirectly from __procdgram (result: coredump
    usually in memmove, unless adns_if_noautosys was used).
  * Do not scramble innards when a query on the output queue is cancelled.
  * Do not close tcp socket twice.
  * Mailboxes containing spaces in their names are quoted.
  * Give ESRCH, not EAGAIN, if _check called with no queries outstanding.
  * adns_rr_hostaddr naddrs is -1 on temporary failure (as documented).
  * Reject TXT RRs with no strings.
  * Correct error messages for qname CNAME foo, foo CNAME bar.
  * adns_processany actually does something.
  * Fixed typos in adns.h.

  General improvements:
  * Promise not to change fds in adns_beforepoll (if now is specified).
  * Improved textual error string for _s_prohibitedcname.
  * New comment in adns_processany and return 0 (not r which is 0).
  * Documentation of resolv.conf directives and options, and of environment
    variables understood, in adns.h
  * Regression test scripts set EF_DISABLE_BANNER (for Electric Fence).

  Portability and build improvements:
  * Give install the '-c' flag (otherwise some delete the original !).
  * Do not remove top-level Makefile on `make clean'.
  * Don't complain so much about poll(2) tests if not available.
  * Do not give -u 0 -g 0 options to install.
  * Remove trailing , from some enums in adns.h.
  * Dynamically linked clients now made with -l, so as to avoid rpath.
  * Do not use $^ in make rules (should help with non-GNU make).
  * Declare flags parameters as ints not enums because C++ is crap.

 -- Ian Jackson <ian@davenant.greenend.org.uk>  Wed, 13 Oct 1999 02:24:35 +0100

adns (0.4) unstable; urgency=high

  General important bugfixes:
  * make _qf_owner work if _qf_search not specified, and test it (oops!)
  * ads->configerrno now initialised (in setup.c).
  * timercmp(,,<=) doesn't work - use !timercmp(,,>).
  * Changed memory semantics of internal queries to fix bugs.
  * Restarting a TCP-using query (eg due to CNAME) doesn't abort.
  
  Fixes for handling of broken kinds of reply:
  * Only accept a reply from the subset of servers we sent the query.
  * Ignore CNAME(s) in answer after RR(s) (and test).

  Other bugfixes and improvements:
  * adns_s_systemfail is in table of errors (for eg adns_strerror).
  * Do not ship config.cache, Makefile, etc.
  * Improvements to install instructions, TODO, etc.
  * Regression tests compile on systems without poll(2).
  * Do not install adnstest_s.
  * _submit returns ENOSYS, not adns_s_unknownquery; documented, tested.
  * <adns.h> includes <sys/types.h>, <sys/time.h>, <unistd.h>.

 -- Ian Jackson <ian@davenant.greenend.org.uk>  Thu, 5 Aug 1999 01:17:38 +0100

adns (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  Incompatible changes:
  * Low adns_status values (below adns_s_max_tempfail) renumbered to make
    room for future locally-induced and locally-detected errors.
  * Event loop functions for use by select(2) renamed and tidied up.
  
  Features / improvements:
  * New adns_errabbrev() for getting status abbreviation strings.
  * regress/checkall prints summary list of failed tests, if any.
  * Event loop functions for poll(2), and some raw variants.
  * adnstest has ability to use poll(2), and user can set initflags.
  * checkall prints passed list as well as failed list, if any failed.
  * You can iterate over outstanding queries (but only once at a time).
  
  Bugfixes:
  * Non-RFC822 mailbox `domain' formatting now works, and clarified.
  * Rejection of bad characters in domains (without quoteok) works.
  * Clean up parents from adns->childw (otherwise would abort/segfault).
  * In adnstest, allocate enough space for, and terminate, query types.
  * In adnstest, don't print errno values as adns_status values.
 
  * Added TODO file.
  * Made adnstest.c test context pointers.

adns (0.2) experimental; urgency=low

  Portability fixes for compilation on various platforms:
  * Include <sys/socket.h> and <netinet/in.h> in files with <arpa/inet.h>.
  * Don't use GCC union assignment feature (.rrs=0 => .rrs.untyped=0).
  * Explictly cast things to [const] struct sockaddr* in syscall args.
  * Check whether we need -lsocket.
  * Include <sys/times.h> in a few more files.
  * Include <unistd.h> and <sys/time.h> for select.
  * Look for inet_aton and inet_ntoa (in -lnsl and -lsocket).
  * LDLIBS removed from dependency lists (some makes don't support this).
  * An `ambiguous else' warning from some compilers in types.c is removed.

  Other changes:
  * Added COPYING (copy of the GPL).
  * Regression test failure output improved.
  * Missing targets in regress/Makefile.in added.
  * Regression test doesn't rely on value of fcntl flags eg O_NONBLOCK.
