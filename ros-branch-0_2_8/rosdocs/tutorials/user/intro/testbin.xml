<title>Booting ReactOS</title>
<para>
Reboot your system in plain DOS 
Change directory to C:\reactos 
Type "boot" or "aboot" at the command prompt (aboot.bat is the boot script with ACPI support). 
You should observe a few messages as drivers load.
Wait until the prompt reappears (the screen should turn blue while ReactOS boots). 
Go on to next section.
