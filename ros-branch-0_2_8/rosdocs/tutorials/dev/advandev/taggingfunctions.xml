<title>1 Overview</title>
<para>
We define tagging a function as the process of associating metadata with a function. We define a tag to be a piece of information that has a well-defined meaning.
A tag has one attribute - a name. The name of a tag always begin with the at sign (@) and it can include only the letters a-z and digits 0-9 and the underscore (_).
Tagnames are case-insensitive. In the future a tag could have one more attribute - a value, but this is currently not needed.

In ReactOS, tags are currently only used to track compatibility with Microsoft APIs, but it could be used for so much more.
Tags are applied to functions by including them in a comment just before the function. Eg. if you have a function called MyFunction,
then you can tag it with the tag @mytag like this:
<programlisting>
/*
 * @mytag
 */
VOID
MyFunction()
{
}
</programlisting>
</para>

</para>

<title>2 Microsoft API compatibility</title>
<para>
Two tags are defined to track compatibility with Microsoft APIs. @implemented and @unimplemented.
Apply @implemented to functions which match and behaves like a Microsoft API.
Use @unimplemented to functions which match, but does not behave like a Microsoft API.
The regenstat tool (located in reactos/tools/rgenstat) will parse the source code for these tags and generate an xml file containing functions that have these tags.
The xml file can be processed by the rapistatus.xsl xml stylesheet (located in reactos/tools/rgenstat/web) to create an html file suitable for display using a browser.
