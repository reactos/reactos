<title>Finding a person to send the patch to</title>
<para>
Since ReactOS does not have a definite maintainer for each section of the code, you should mail ros-kernel and ask for someone to accept the patch.

<title>Test your patch</title>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>Thoroughly check that your change works as intended.</listitem>
<listitem>Test your changes with the latest code from CVS. Something may have changed in the latest code that either breaks your change or causes your change to break something else.</listitem>
<listitem>Make sure that ReactOS can still boot and that any applications or systems that may be affected by your change still run properly.</listitem>

<title>Preparing the patch</title>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>Make sure that your patch is against the latest code from CVS.</listitem>
<listitem>Where you have made changes to an existing source file, you will use diff to obtain a file that contains only the changes that you have made:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>Make sure you have cvs and diff on your system (cvs.exe and diff.exe on Windows). If you use Windows and don't have these tools, you can obtain WinCVS from <ulink url="http://www.wincvs.org/">http://www.wincvs.org/</ulink> (remember to put the WinCVS directory in your path).</listitem>
<listitem>To create the patch:
<programlisting>
cvs diff -up file1 file2 > mypatch.diff
</programlisting>
</listitem>
<listitem>If you have changed many files, then you can avoid typing each filename by doing this:
<programlisting>
cd &lt;top-directory-for-all-changed-files&gt;
cvs diff -up > mypatch.diff
</programlisting>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>
<listitem>Zip all new files and diffs to existing files and send them to the person that will commit the changes to CVS.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
