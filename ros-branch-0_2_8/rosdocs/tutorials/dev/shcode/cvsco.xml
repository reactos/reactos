<title>Modules in ReactOS' CVS Repository</title>
<para>
There are several modules in ReactOS' CVS repository. Each of these modules contains a seperate tree of files. Whenever you check out a tree, you must specify which module you want. The following modules are available in our repository:
<table>
<title>Modules</title>
<tgroup cols="2">
<thead>
<row>
<entry>Module Name</entry>
<entry>Description</entry>
</row>
</thead>
<tbody>
<row>
<entry>reactos</entry>
<entry>Source code of the ReactOS kernel, subsystems and drivers</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry>rosapps</entry>
<entry>Source code of various applications that will be bundled with ReactOS</entry>
</row>
<row>
<entry>rosdocs</entry>
<entry>ReactOS documentation: at the moment a set of DocBook XML files</entry>
</row>
</tbody>
</tgroup>

<title>Checking out a tree (module)</title>
<para>
First go to the directory that you want to check the tree out into. Then issue the command
<programlisting>
cvs -z 9 checkout module
</programlisting>
(where module is the name of one of the modules mentioned above). The "-z 9" switch is to use maximum compression to shorten download time. You might also notice that each directory checked out by cvs contains a subdirectory names "cvs". These subdirectory should not removed as they contain important CVS user and versioning information. You will not be able to properly update your tree if you remove one of these "cvs" subdirectories.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Examples</title>
<para>
To check out the "reactos" module, we will first create a "ros" directory that will contain all modules from the repository and then do the check out:
<programlisting>
<prompt>C:\></prompt>md ros
<prompt>C:\></prompt>cd ros
<prompt>C:\ROS></prompt>cvs -z 9 checkout reactos
</programlisting>
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Updating your tree</title>
<para>
The next section "Updating your tree with the latest code" will explain how to use the "update" CVS command to update your tree with the latest changes. You should only have to check out a tree once and perform updates on the tree after that. If you encounter abnormalities with your tree in the future, however, you may wish to delete it and do a checkout again (this should be a rare occurance).
