To All Licensees, Distributors of Any Version of BSD: 

As you know, certain of the Berkeley Software Distribution ("BSD") source code files 
require that further distributions of products containing all or portions of the 
software, acknowledge within their advertising materials that such products contain 
software developed by UC Berkeley and its contributors. 

Specifically, the provision reads: 

      * 3. All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software
      *    must display the following acknowledgement:
      *    This product includes software developed by the University of
      *    California, Berkeley and its contributors.

Effective immediately, licensees and distributors are no longer required to include 
the acknowledgement within advertising materials. Accordingly, the foregoing paragraph 
of those BSD Unix files containing it is hereby deleted in its entirety.
