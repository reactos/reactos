Window Classes:

Window classes define the behavior of windows. Each class has its own
unique reaction to messages. Classes derive from other classes.

Window Attributes:

Every window has an attribute word that defines some of its
appearance and behavior. The following values are bitwise flags that
OR together to make a window's attributes.

You can establish default attributes for a window's class, add
additional attributes when you create the window, and use the
AddAttribute, ClearAttribute, and TestAttribute macros to change and
test a window's attributes.

    SHADOW       has a shadow
    MOVEABLE     can move the window with mouse or cursor
    SIZEABLE     can resize the window with mouse or cursor
    HASMENUBAR   has a menubar (an application window)
    VSCROLLBAR   has a vertical scroll bar
    HSCROLLBAR   has a horizontal scroll bar
    VISIBLE      is visible
    SAVESELF     saves its own video memory
    TITLEBAR     has a title bar 
    CONTROLBOX   has a control box and control menu
    MINMAXBOX    has a min/max box 
    NOCLIP       is not clipped to its parent's borders
    READONLY     is a readonly textbox
    MULTILINE    is a multiline editbox or listbox
    HASBORDER    has a border
    HASSTATUSBAR has a statusbar (application window only)

Messages:

A D-Flat program is message-driven. You initiate message processing
with the init_messages function, create a window with the
CreateWindow function, and go into the message dispatching loop with
the dispatch_message function. 

A window can have a window-processing function. When the user causes
events to occur by pressing keys and using the mouse, D-Flat sends
messages to the window's function. That function can send messages to
itself and other windows with the SendMessage and PostMessage
functions.

Windows are declared as members of a class. Every class has a default
window-processing function. If you do not provide one for an instance
of a window class, the default one receives messages for the window.
Your custom window-processing function--if one exists--should chain to
the default window-processing function for the blass by calling the
DefaultWndProc function.

There are five things a window-processing function can do with a
message:
  - ignore it and let the D-Flat default processing occur.
  - suppress it by returning without chaining to the default
    window-processing function for the window class.
  - chain to the default window-processing function and then do some
    additional processing.
  - do some preliminary processing and then chain to the default
    window-processing function.
  - do all the processing of the message and then return without 
    chaining to the default window-processing function for the 
    window class.

Following are the messages that an application program would use.
There are other messages, but they are used by D-Flat only.

=====================================================

API Functions & Macros:

These are functions and macros defined for use by applications
programs. There are many others defined in the header files. These
others are for D-Flat to use, and programmers need not be concerned
about them except as an expression of their curiosity about how
D-Flat works.


(Note: These specifications are not in any orderly sequence yet.)


-------------------------------------------------------------------
void init_messages(void)

Call this function first to initialize message processing. Continue
only if the function returns a true value. Otherwise, terminate the
processing of your program. A false return occurs from a longjmp that
is executed when D-Flat attempts to allocate memory that is not
available.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
WINDOW CreateWindow(
    CLASS Class,              /* class of this window       */
    char *ttl,                /* title or NULL              */
    int left, int top,        /* upper left coordinates     */
    int height, int width,    /* dimensions                 */
    void *extension,          /* pointer to additional data */
    WINDOW parent,            /* parent of this window      */
    int (*wndproc)(struct window *,MESSAGE,PARAM,PARAM),
    int attrib)               /* window attribute           */

This function creates a window. It returns the WINDOW handle that
messages and functions use to identify the window. If you specify
NULL for the parent, the APPLICATION window becomes the parent.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
void PostMessage(WINDOW wnd, MESSAGE msg, PARAM p1, PARAM p2)

Post a message to a window. The window will receive the message in
turn during the message-dispatching loop.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
int SendMessage(WINDOW wnd, MESSAGE msg, PARAM p1, PARAM p2)

Send a message to a window. The window will receive the message
immediately. Control returns to the sender after the window has
processed the message. The window can return an integer value.

This function can send system messages to NULL. System messages
are ones that D-Flat processes without regard to a particular window.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
int dispatch_message(void)

The message dispatching loop. After opening the first window (usually
the applications window), continue to call this function until it
returns a FALSE value.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
void handshake(void)

This function dispatches messages without allowing any keyboard or
click events to pass through. You use it to allow the clock to run or
the watch icon to move during a lengthy process without allowing
anything to execute a command that might interfere with what your
program is doing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
int TestCriticalError(void)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
int DefaultWndProc(WINDOW wnd, MESSAGE msg, PARAM p1, PARAM p2)

multiple-line selection listbox is selected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
int DialogBox(
  WINDOW wnd,        /* parent window of the dialog box        */
  DBOX *db,          /* address of dialog box definition array */
  int Modal,         /* true if it is a modal dialog box       */
  int (*wndproc)(struct window *, MESSAGE, PARAM, PARAM)
                     /* the window processing function or NULL */
)

This function executes a dialog box. If it is a modal dialog box, the
function does not return until the user completes the dialog box. The
return value will be true if the user has selected OK and false if
the user has selected Cancel on the dialog box. If the dialog box is
modeless, the function returns immediately, and the user can select
other things from the screen while the dialog box is still active.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
WINDOW ControlWindow(DBOX *db, enum commands cmd)

This function returns the WINDOW handle of the control specified by
the cmd parameter.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
void MessageBox(char *title, char *message)
void CancelBox(wnd, char *message)
void ErrorMessage(char *message)
int TestErrorMessage(char *message)
int YesNoBox(char *question)
WINDOW MomentaryMessage(char *message)

These functions display generic message boxes. The message text is
one null-terminated string with newlines (\n) to indicate where lines
are to be broken. The size of the boxes adjusts to the width of the
longest line and the number of lines of text. A message may have no
more lines of text than will fit into the largest window that the
screen can display. You must account for the window's border's and
the presence at the bottom of one or more command buttons.

The MessageBox function displays a message in a window with a title
provided by the caller. The window contains the message and an OK
command button.

The CancelBox function displays a message in a window with a
"Wait..." title. The window contains the message and a Cancel command
button. If the user presses the Cancel button before the program
closes the window, the COMMAND, ID_CANCEL message is sent to the
parent window.

The ErrorMessage function displays the message in an error box window
with an OK command button.

The TestErrorMessage function is an error message with OK and Cancel
command buttons. The function returns true if the user selects OK or
presses Enter and false if the user selects Cancel or presses Esc.

The YesNoBox function displays the message with Yes and No command
buttons. The function returns true if the user selects Yes or
presses Enter and false if the user selects No or presses Esc.

The MomentaryMessage function displays a message box and returns its
WINDOW handle. The caller must close the window. The purpose of this
function is to allow you to display a message while some time
consuming process is underway and then erase the message after the
process is done but without any action required from the user.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
int InputBox(WINDOW wnd, char *ttl, char *msg, char *text, int len, int wd)

This function executes a generic one-line user input dialog box. The
wnd parameter is the parent window of the dialog box. The ttl
parameter points to a title string for the dialog box. The msg
parameter points to a prompting text message. The text parameter
points to the string that will receive the user's input. The len
parameter is the length of the input string not including the null
terminator. The wd parameter is the width of the string display. If
the wd parameter is 0, the function computes a width based on the len
parameter.

The function returns a true value if the user chooses the OK command
button and false if the user selects Cancel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
WINDOW SliderBox(int len, char *ttl, char *msg)

This function displays a dialog box with the specified title and
message, a slider bar of the specified length, and a Cancel button.
The slider bar displays a percent value.

You use the slider box to display feedback to the user when the
program is doing a time-consuming task, such as printing a file.
Periodically, through your process, you send a PAINT message to the
window handle that the SliderBox function returns. The second
parameter is the new percent value. When you have sent 100, the
slider dialog box closes itself. If the user chooses the Cancel
command on the dialog box, your next PAINT message returns FALSE.
Otherwise it returns TRUE.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
int RadioButtonSetting(DBOX *db, enum commands cmd)

This function returns true if the specified command on the specified
dialog box is a pressed radio button.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
void PutItemText(WINDOW wnd, enum commands cmd, char *text)

This function appends a line of text to a TEXT, TEXTBOX, EDITBOX,
LISTBOX, SPINBUTTON, or COMBOBOX control window in a dialog box. The
wnd parameter is the WINDOW handle of the dialog box. The cmd
parameter specifies the command associated with the control item. The
text parameter points to the text to be added. The control window
makes its own copy of the text, so the caller's copy can go out of
scope.  If the control window is a COMBOBOX, TEXTBOX, or EDITBOX
window, you must send a PAINT message to the control window so that
the new text will display.

You must call this function while the dialog box is active. That
means that if the dialog box is modal, you must call this function
from within a custom window processing function that you supply when
you call DialogBox.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
void PutComboListText(WINDOW wnd, enum commands cmd, char *text)

This function appends a line of text to the LISTBOX of a COMBOBOX
control window in a dialog box. The wnd parameter is the WINDOW
handle of the dialog box. The cmd parameter specifies the command
associated with the combo box. The text parameter points to the
text to be added. The control window makes its own copy of the text,
so the caller's copy can go out of scope.

You must call this function while the dialog box is active. That
means that if the dialog box is modal, you must call this function
from within a custom window processing function that you supply when
you call DialogBox.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
void GetItemText(WINDOW wnd, enum commands cmd, char *text, int length)

This function copies the text from a TEXT, TEXTBOX, COMBOBOX, or
EDITBOX control window in a dialog box. The wnd parameter is the
WINDOW handle of the dialog box. The cmd parameter specifies the
command associated with the control item. The text parameter points
to the caller's buffer where the text will be copied. The length
parameter specifies the maximum number of characters to copy.

You must call this function while the dialog box is active. That
means that if the dialog box is modal, you must call this function
from within a custom window processing function that you supply when
you call DialogBox.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

char *GetComboBoxText(DBOX *db, enum commands cmd)

This function returns a pointer to the text associated with an
combo box control in a dialog box. You can call it after the dialog box
has completed processing. The buffer is on the heap. Do not free it.
Instead, call SetEditBoxText with a NULL pointer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
void SetEditBoxText(DBOX *db, enum commands cmd, char *text)

This function sets the text of a dialog box editbox. You can call
this function before or while the dialog box is open. The dialog box
makes its own copy on the heap, so your text can go out of scope.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
void SetComboBoxText(DBOX *db, enum commands cmd, char *text)

This function sets the text of a dialog box combo box. You can call
this function before or while the dialog box is open. The dialog box
makes its own copy on the heap, so your text can go out of scope.

Assumes that a previous SearchText call has found a match. Searches
for the next match of the same string in the specified EDITBOX
window.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
void WriteTextLine(WINDOW wnd, RECT *rcc, int y, int reverse)

This function displays a text line from a TEXTBOX or derived window
class. The text has already been added to the window with ADDTEXT,
etc. The y parameter specifies which line (0, 1, ...) relative to the
window's text buffer to display. If the specified line is not in
view, the function does nothing. If the reverse parameter is true,
the line displays in the reverse-video colors of the window. The rcc
RECT pointer is usually NULL for applications calls. It points to a
rectangle relative to the window outside of which displays will not
occur. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
void PutWindowLine(WINDOW wnd, void *s, int x, int y)

This function writes a line of text to a window. The x and y
coordinates point to the first character in the window's client area
where the line is to be written. The text must be null-terminated.
This function clips the line if it goes beyond the window or the
screen. The function clips the line if it goes outside the borders of
the window's parent. If other windows overlap the target window, the
text is clipped. Do not use negative values in x or y.

You can assign color values to the global variables foreground and
background to affect the color of the line's display.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
void PutWindowChar(WINDOW wnd, int c, int x, int y)

This function writes the character c to a window. The x and y
coordinates are relative to the window's client area.

The function performs clipping. If the character is beyond the
window's or the screen's borders it is not written. If the window
does not have the NOCLIP attribute, the character is not written if
its coordinates are beyond the margins of its parent window (if the
window has a parent). If other windows overlap the target window, the
text is clipped. Do not use negative values in x or y.

You can assign color values to the global variables foreground and
background to affect the color of the character's display.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
void DrawVector(WINDOW wnd, int x, int y, int len, int hv)
