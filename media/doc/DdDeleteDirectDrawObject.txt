DdDeleteDirectDrawObject

we need release directdraw handler the cache or not cache handler
1. check see if DirectDrawGlobal->hDD is NULL or not

2. if both cache directdraw handler and public handler is NULL
   then we need return false, fail to release it or it was already release

3. if public directdraw handler is not null we need release it
   and return if we susses or not.

4. we need check if we need rest the internal cache if public being release


use  NtGdiDdDeleteDirectDrawObject((HANDLE)DirectDrawGlobal->hDD);
to release a directdraw handler.
