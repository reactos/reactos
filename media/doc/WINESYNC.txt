# ReactOS WINE porting/syncing reference file
# Update this file when you port/sync a dll/program from WINE.

The ReactOS Project shares quite a bit of code with the WINE project.
This document should provide a complete reference for all of the
locations in the ReactOS source tree where code is shared between the
two projects. If you find something is missing from this documentation
please add it.

If you find that a function in ReactOS that is not implemented properly
and is based on WINE sources, check the latest Winehq CVS and see if
it has been fixed there. If so, please submit a patch to
ros-dev@reactos.org. Otherwise please send a patch to both
wine-patches@winehq.com and ros-dev@reactos.org
