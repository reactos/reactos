* Critical path tasks
       	Test and debug Registry routines
	Implement file cache
	Implement paging

* These tasks would be nice
       Separate HAL into KM DLL

* Function groups totally or partially unimplemented

       Dma functions (see hal/x86/dma.c)
       Shutdown support (see ex/power.c)
       Zw(Set/Get)SystemInformation (see ex/sysinfo.c)
       Io cancelation support (see io/cancel, et al)
       Directory change notification (see io/dir.c)
       Error logging (see io/errlog.c)
       Io completion ports (see io/iocomp.c)
       File locking (see io/lock.c)
       Hardware resource management (see io/resource.c)
       Exception support (see ke/catch.c)
       Mutex support (see nt/mutex.c)

* Verify implementation


* Major areas

       Security support (see se/*.c)
       SCSI miniport driver

* Drivers
       NTFS, EXT2 filesystems
       Many others (use oem's where possible)

* For the future
       DOS, Win16, POSIX subsystems
