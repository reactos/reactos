------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 1. We use only the correct Romanian language diacritics.
     This means using lowercase ţ instead of ț.
     This means using lowercase ş instead of ș.
     This means using uppercase Ş instead of Ș.
     Some of XP/2k3sp2 fonts do lack ț and ș and Ș.
 2. We will make a correct translation both grammatically and literally.
 3. All of the accelerators and of the translations will follow the MSDN's rules as much as possible. We will keep the same XP/2003 (and newer) accelerators.
