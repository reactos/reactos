The UNI-VGA font can be distributed and modified freely, according to the X license.
The Basic Latin block was taken almost unchanged from DosEmu's vga.bdf. All the other blocks (except noted) were created mainly from scratch by me, Dmitry Bolkhovityanov.
Letters in the Hebrew block were taken unchanged from a public domain hebrew console font.
Glyphs in Arabic, Arabic Presentation Forms-A, Arabic Presentation Forms-B and U+262B Farsi symbol were kindly donated by Behdad Esfahbod.
Thanks to Birger Langkjer for idea, to Mark Leisher for his wonderful XmBDFEd, and to many others for their support.
