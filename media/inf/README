Internationalization of INF-files:

For internationalization of INF-files each [Strings]-section needs a language
specific additional section. This section has the name [Strings.LanguageId] e.g.
[Strings.0407] for German. During setup dependent on the system language the
language dependent substitations will be applied and the result will be 
stored in the registry. That's the way Microsoft described in MSDN:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms794543.aspx
The result is, that we have a system language, where all strings are 
translated in best case. A fictional example:

[a_inf_section]

an_arbitrary_key = %value_1%

[Strings]

value_1 = "english version value_1"

[Strings.0407]

value_1 = "deutsche version value_1"

All of the INF-files containting translated strings have to be encoded in 
16 bit unicode (UTF-16) with byte order mark.
Remember, during installation we make one translated version and store that to
registry, all other versions provided in INF-file will discard. Due to this
fact, there is (at least) one question left: How to realize multiple system
languages simultanously in a Microsoft compatible manner? A suggestion is to
store all translations in registry. Let's assume we have a key (like in example
above) in registry:

an_arbitrary_key = "english version value_1"

Whether it's a translated or the english default one. For each other language
that comes with INF-file we create a new key in the Strings.LanguageID manner:

an_arbitrary_key.0407 = "deutsche version value_1"

In the hope Micrsosft OS will ignore the additional keys, we can use it to 
handle multiple languages at the same time with a default language as well not
limited to english. Additional to Windows we have to implement/modify the 
registry-related functions to consider the language specific keys, but that's
a little effort and i think it doesn't lead into incompatibility.
To prevent a bloated registry we could modify that way and add the translated 
strings to registry only if a user select new (still uninstalled) language.

General issues of multiple (system) languages:

We can translate the programm files and perhaps the registry entries in the 
described way above. But how to handle files/directories with translatabel
names? If we intend to have a (native) language for each user, so the directory 
structure may become confusing and may be hard to handle correctly.

For the future I recommend a modified MUI-System, maybe we can include the
advantages of gettext of Linux/Unix-systems and store the translations or
language specific stuff at a central place instead of the programm directory.
