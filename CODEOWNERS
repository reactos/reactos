##   List of maintainers for the ReactOS project

## This file purpose is to give newcomers to the project the responsible
## developers when submitting a pull request on GitHub, or opening a bug
## report on Jira.

## This file will notably establish who is responsible for a specific
## area of ReactOS. Being a maintainer means the following:
##  - that person has good knownledge in the area
##  - that person is able to enforce consistency in the area
##  - that person may be available for giving help in the area
##  - that person has push access on the repository
## Being a maintainer does not mean the following:
##  - that person is dedicated to the area
##  - that person is working full-time on the area/on ReactOS
##  - that person is paid
##  - that person is always available

## We have no supported (paid) areas in ReactOS.

## When submitting a pull request on GitHub and looking for reviewers,
## look at that file and ask for a review from some of the people (M, R
## - the most recently active in the area) listed in the matching area,
## also, assign the pull request to the M person. Don't ask for a review
## from all the listed reviewers.
## Also, when submitted a pull request on GitHub, rules defined in
## CONTRIBUTING.md apply. And if the maintainer is not available and
## reviewers approved the pull request, developers feeling confident
## can merge the pull request. Note that reviewers do not necessarily
## have push access to the repository.
## When submitting a bug report on Jira, if you want to be sure to have
## a developer with skills in that area, write @nick from M people.

## There should be one and only one primary maintainer per area.

## In case of 3rd party code (also refered as upstream), the maintainer
## is responsible of updating periodically the source code and of
## managing local patches. He is not here to upstream code on your behalf.
## As responsible, he may refuse a local patch if you did not try to
## upstream your changes.

## If you want to get listed in that file, either put yourself in the
## file and push it, or open a pull request. You can also ask a person
## who has push access to add yourself.

## This file uses GitHub's format for specifying code owners.
##  - Lines starting with # are comment lines.
##  - All other lines specify a path / file (wildcards allowed) followed
##    by the GitHub user name(s) of the code owners.
## See https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-code-owners

## Additionally it tries to use a similar format to the Linux kernel
## MAINTAINERS file within comments.
## Descriptions of comment section entries used here:
##  M: Primary maintainer. Assign them pull requests
##     Use the GitHub, Jira, Real Name format for entry, squash if
##     some are overlapping
##  R: Reviewers. Ask them for review on pull requests
##  S: Status, one of the following:
##     Maintained:  Someone is handling that area
##     Upstream: This is 3rd party code, synced in our tree
##     Abandoned:  No one is handling that code anymore
##  F: Files. Directories, files (wildcards allowed) covered in
##     this area
##  C: Comments
