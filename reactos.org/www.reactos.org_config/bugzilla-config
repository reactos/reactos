# files for you that will instruct Apache not to serve files that shouldn't
# be accessed from the web (like your local configuration data and non-cgi
# executable files).  For this to work, the directory your Bugzilla
# installation is in must be within the jurisdiction of a <Directory> block
# in the httpd.conf file that has 'AllowOverride Limit' in it.  If it has
# 'AllowOverride All' or other options with Limit, that's fine.
# (Older Apache installations may use an access.conf file to store these
# <Directory> blocks.)

# will be _VERY_ insecure, because some files will be world readable/writable,
# and so anyone who can get local access to your machine can do whatever they
# want. You should only have this set to "" if this is a testing installation
# and you cannot set this up any other way. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

# asAdministrator, or as a user who is a member of the specified group.
