    <p>When you view an administrative form in [% terms.Bugzilla %], a token string
    is randomly generated and stored both in the database and in the form you loaded,
    to make sure that the requested changes are being made as a result of submitting
    a form generated by [% terms.Bugzilla %]. Unfortunately, the token used right now
    is incorrect, meaning that it looks like you didn't come from the right page.
    The following token has been used :</p>

    It looks like you didn't come from the right page (you have no valid token for
    the <em>[% expected_action FILTER html %]</em> action while processing the
    '[% script_name FILTER html%]' script). The reason could be one of:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>You clicked the "Back" button of your web browser after having successfully
      submitted changes, which is generally not a good idea (but harmless).</li>
      <li>You entered the URL in the address bar of your web browser directly,
      which should be safe.</li>
      <li>You clicked on a URL which redirected you here <b>without your consent</b>,
      in which case this action is much more critical.</li>
    </ul>
    Are you sure you want to commit these changes anyway? This may result in
    unexpected and undesired results.
