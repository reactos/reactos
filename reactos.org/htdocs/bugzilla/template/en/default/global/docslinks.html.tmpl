[%# INTERFACE:
  # docslinks: hash. Hash keys will be used as text of the documentation links,
  #            hash values will be used as links to the document, relative to
  #            the main Bugzilla documentation directory.
  #            Example: If you want a 'FAQ' link to point to, the "faq-general"
  #            named anchor on faq.html, assign
  #               { 'FAQ' => "faq.html#faq-general" }
  #            to docslinks.
  #            You may only link to sections by their given ID; it is not allowed
  #            to link to a section which is not given an ID (thus getting
  #            assigned an automatically generated ID). Otherwise, the link
  #            would break on a recompilation of the documentation.
  # admindocslinks: hash. Same as docslinks, but will only be displayed to
  #                 members of the admin group.
