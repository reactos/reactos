Subject: Your [% terms.Bugzilla %] buglist needs attention.
X-Bugzilla-Type: whine

[This e-mail has been automatically generated.]

You have one or more [% terms.bugs %] assigned to you in the [% terms.Bugzilla %] 
[% terms.bug %] tracking system ([% Param("urlbase") %]) that require
attention.

All of these [% terms.bugs %] are in the [% status_descs.NEW %] or 
[% status_descs.REOPENED %] state, and have not been
touched in [% Param("whinedays") %] days or more.
You need to take a look at them, and decide on an initial action.

Generally, this means one of three things:

(1) You decide this [% terms.bug %] is really quick to deal with (like, it's [% get_resolution("INVALID") %]),
    and so you get rid of it immediately.
(2) You decide the [% terms.bug %] doesn't belong to you, and you reassign it to
    someone else. (Hint: if you don't know who to reassign it to, make
    sure that the Component field seems reasonable, and then use the
    "Reassign [% terms.bug %] to default assignee of selected component" option.)
(3) You decide the [% terms.bug %] belongs to you, but you can't solve it this moment.
    Just use the "Accept [% terms.bug %]" command.

To get a list of all [% status_descs.NEW %]/[% status_descs.REOPENED %] [%+ terms.bugs %], you can use this URL (bookmark
it if you like!):

 [% Param("urlbase") %]buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=REOPENED&assigned_to=[% email %]

Or, you can use the general query page, at 
[%+ Param("urlbase") %]query.cgi

Appended below are the individual URLs to get to all of your [% status_descs.NEW %] [%+ terms.bugs %]
that haven't been touched for a week or more.

You will get this message once a day until you've dealt with these [% terms.bugs %]!

[% FOREACH bug = bugs %]
 [%+ bug.summary %]
    -> [% Param("urlbase") %]show_bug.cgi?id=[% bug.id %]
[% END %]
