The code in this subtree is networking UI. lmui stands for "Lan Manager User
Interface". The directories:

debug -- debugging support
netobjs -- property sheets for SMB network objects
ntshrui -- Sharing in the shell. See ntshrui\ntshrui.doc
ntshrui.new -- Sharing in the shell, with remote sharing capabilities. This
    code is not finished or tested.
shareui -- The Shared Directories Folder, in the Resource Kit
shareui.new -- shareui with support for SFM and FPNW in addition to SMB shares.
    This is most definitely not finished.
