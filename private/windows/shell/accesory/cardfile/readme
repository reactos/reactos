|      0/1, int       - Tells whether the card contains an object.
|      id, DWORD      - A unique object number, used for link management
|      OLE Object     - OleLoadFromStream will read this.
|      CharWid, int   - Character width, used for device independence
|      CharHgt, int   - Character height
|      RECT           - Rectangle in pixels where the object resides
|      Object Type    - 0 = EMBEDDED, 1 = LINKED, 2 = STATIC
|
|      text size, int  (as before)
|      text

|It's possible that it would be better to save CharHt and CharWd 
|at the top of the card file, to save space... but I don't, currently.
|I guess this will allow cardfiles to be edited across devices w/o having

Notes
-----
This application has been written in an attempt to minimize memory usage.
It only keeps all of the card headers plus the text/picture of the current
card in memory; everything else is on disk.  If a card is modified, it
is marked as dirty; and when the focus moves away from it, it is written
to a temporary file.  Thus, when a cardfile is written, it writes out the
card header and merges the old file with the temporary file.  When a cardfile
is read, only the card headers are read; and then the current card is read.

The contents of the current card have been modified to store a RECT which
gives the coordinates of the picture; the picture, which is an OLE Object
(except in the case of real mode, when the object's selector is filled in
with 0 and the displacement really represents an HBITMAP); and the text,
which is just read into an MLE.  The file Picture.C handles the majority of
the picture manipulation, processing the LPECDOBJECT or HBITMAP as appropriate.

Printing of OLE objects is accomplished by converting the image to a 
monochrome BITMAP, and using the old printing code.  This conversion also
takes place if the user wants to save old 3.0 compatible files.

The registration database is called to initialize the Change Link... dialog
and to interpret the server key strings.  The server keys, even though they
appear readable (e.g. "PBrush") should not be displayed if possible, because
their key values are NLS/localizable strings (e.g. "PaintBrush Picture").

The ...ClientDoc() functions were added to support the link management which
will be present in Windows 3.2.  Currently, all this will do is that it will
cause the file name being edited by the application to be prepended to object
names when editing objects (e.g. "(untitled)%Embedded #01").

There was a bug where the common dialogs would not function correctly in real
mode:  This resulted because the lpstr fields like lpstrFile were initialized
once in InitInstance(), but since the DS moved, the addresses were not valid
upon later calls to the library.  The solution is to re-init these fields before
each call.  For the "Search/Find" dialog box, it is necessary to allocate a
memory chunk and lock it, because the dialog is modeless (and the DS can move
while the dialog is active).

The new cardfile file format includes the width and height of character units.
If on a device with the same character size, the objects will not move when you
save them.  Otherwise, Scale() is called to give the correct size on the new
display device.  The objects may move upwards/leftwards because of roundoff 
errors.  

Possible Improvements
---------------------
Currently, when printing OLE objects I create a monochrome BITMAP copy of the
image.  If this BITMAP were made to be compatible with the printing device, I
think that color printing can also be supported by CardFile.

InitPhoneList is called at several places. Instead of doing an LB_INSERTSTRING,
LB_DELETESTRING, the list box is reinitialized every time an entry changes.
Procedures to add/delete an item from the list box should be used instead.

Should replace IndexOkError with ErrorMessage and also make ErrorMessage
return FALSE to facilitate error return from functions.

May be we can get rid of the C run times like strchr(use MyStrChr instead) etc,
in inprint.c.If we badly need a few of them still, use local versions of 
atoi,atol etc.

Subject: new format to handle unicode
Author: Chris Walker

The only difference in the unicode format is the signature (DKO)
and the characters, now 16 bits wide.
