PBrush surgery notes:

What are the windows?

pbrushWnd[i] ==
	PARENTid 0   "pbParent"	  ParentWP  -- the frame window
	PAINTid  1   "pbPaint"	  PaintWP   -- the drawing surface
	TOOLid   2   "pbTool"	  ToolWP    -- the tool tray
	SIZEid   3   "pbSize"	  SizeWP    -- the line thickness tool
	COLORid  4   "pbColor"	  ColorWP   -- the color tray
	xxxxxxxxxx   "pbFull"     FullWP    -- the preview (full-screen) window
	xxxxxxxxxx   "pbZoomOut"  ZoomOtWP  -- the zoomed-view window


Where are the windows?
    procs:
        Parent	-- PARENTWP.C
        Paint	-- PAINTWP.C
        Tool	-- TOOLWP.C
        Size	-- SIZEWP.C
        Color	-- COLORWP.C

    created:
        Parent	-- WndInitGlob
        Paint	-- WndInitGlob
        Tool	-- WndInitGlob
        Size	-- WndInitGlob
        Color	-- WndInitGlob
	Full	-- MenuCmd
        ZoomOut	-- MenuCmd

    moved/sized:
	ParentWP WM_SIZE procesing moves the children

    shown/hidden:

    destroyed:
        Parent	-- killed in TerminateServer
	Full	-- kills itself
	ZoomOut	-- kills itself

What communication paths exist between the windows?

        Parent	      -- talks to all child windows (below)
		Paint -- talks to "Parent", Paint; uses ZoomIn wndproc
		Tool  -- talks to "Parent", Paint
		Size  -- talks to Paint
		Color -- talks to "Parent", Paint
	Full	      -- talks to Paint
	ZoomOut	      -- talks to "Parent"


=================================
Steps to InPlace:
=================================

1) build a server menu

2) build the InPace window

3) implement reparenting functions

4) additions to tool windows for use in floating-palette mode

5) take it out for a spin, do basic debug, show it off...

6) fix problems uncovered, review changes, incorporate sugestions...

7) build a drop target

8) implement the transfer object, take a stab at drag scrolling

9) set up conversion plumbing for OLE1 PBrush objects

10) debug, debug, debug!


=================================
Problems:
=================================

(1) The Window-positioning problem

There are a number of places in the old PBrush code that cause
a recalc of the size/position of the Paint, Tool, Size and Color
windows.

When InPlace, the new PBrush floats the Tool, Size and Color windows,
and gives the Paint window the full extent of the InPlace window. The
old recalc code hardcoded the positioning relationships between these
windows.

The solution implemented by the new PBrush code is to create simple
tool-tray windows to house the Tool, Size and Color windows and to
cause the old calculation/positioning code to leave these windows alone.
While InPlace (signaled via the global gfInPlace), the trays own
responsibility for setting the positions of the Tool, Size and Color windows.

In addition, the InPlace code causes the Paint, Tool, Size and Color
windows to be reparented to a window owned by the InPlace code. This
reparenting is reversed when the new PBrush UIDeactivates. The InPlace
window also forwards appropriate messages through to the Paint
window and the MenuCmd function so that commands, etc., get processed
as intended.



(2) The Menu-state problem

There are a number of places sprinkled through the old PBrush C code
where menus and sub-items are enabled/disabled. Access to these menus
is inconsistent, often MF_BYPOSITION: somtimes via hard-coded constants,
sometimes via defined constants, and sometimes through static index arrays.

When InPlace, the new PBrush uses a copy of the menu resource which
has had the File and View popups removed (at runtime). File was
removed because it is defined as a container menu. View was removed
because zoom is fundementally problematic for InPlace objects (see RandyKe,
TonyW, or NatBr for a review of the issues).

So, the old PBrush code attempts to access menu positions that are
wrong for the InPlace menus. The solution is to rationalize access
to the menus via shared (global) indexes and functions.


(3) The Mouse-capture problem

Paintbush uses mouse capture extensively. The mouse is captured whenever
a click hits the Paint window, and this capture is released when a mouse-move
event happens for a point outside the Paint window AND a drawing operation
is not being tracked. On Win32 mouse capture is thread-specific, so as long as
mouse moves are happening over a window owned by the same thread as PBrush,
there is a good chance a move message will be seen as the user sweeps out of
the Paint window. Unfortunately, in the LocalServer-InPlace scenario this is
not the case. The result is that the Paint window has no good (early)
opportunity to give up it's capture.

One possible "solution" would be to use the UIActive border as a buffer zone.
What if this zone isn't big enough (and reasonable movements get the cursor
across the zone before capture is released)? One HACK would be to create another,
transparent window under the border and Paint windows. The problem with this
(aside from it's gross overhead) is that a document could be scrolled such
that the PBrush object extends over the clipping boundary, loosing the border
altogether! An even grosser possibility would be to create a top-level
transparent window underneath the PBrush object.

The solution adopted is to NOT capture the cursor (except during tool tracking)
as long as PBrush is InPlace.
