Security

There are three things that need to be secured for each Clipbook
page: the .CLP file for the page, the registry key that links the page name
with the .CLP file name, and the DDE share that allows DDE access to ClipSrv.

The .CLP file and registry key are should be given these accesses:
        Local System (services)         Full Control
        Administrators                  Full Control
        Everybody                       No Access

The DDE share's security can be set by the user using the DACL editor. The
default security is:
        Owner/Creator                   Full Control
        Everybody                       Read and Link
