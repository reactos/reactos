<h1>NetClip: Remote Clipboard Viewer For Windows NT 4.0</h1>
<ul>
<li>Do you have more than one computer? </li>
<li>Have you ever had to &quot;cut &amp; paste&quot; (Rich Text!) from one machine to another?</li>
<li>Have you ever tried to use &quot;Clipbook Viewer&quot;? And wondered why we even bother shipping it?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can say Yes to any of the above, you'll dig NetClip. With NetClip, you can not only view the contents of your other machines' clipboards, 
but you can Drag &amp; Drop (or Cut &amp; Paste) any data, in any format, to and from the other machine.</p>
<p>NetClip uses the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM) to share the clipboard between the two machines. It fully supports Rich Text as 
well as any custom data format supported by your applications.</p>
<p>To install, simply right click on NETCLIP.INF and choose &quot;Install&quot; from the menu.</p>
<p>To use, simply run NETCLIP.EXE on any of your machines. When it starts you'll be viewing your local clipboard. To connect to another 
machine, use the &quot;Connect&quot; toolbar button to enter the machine name. You can enter a NetBIOS name (e.g. &quot;mymachine&quot;) or a DNS name 
(&quot;mymachine.foo.com&quot;) or even an IP address. The disconnect button does what you'd think.</p>
<p>You can also pass a machine name on the command line, allowing you to put a shortcut on your desktop for each of your machines. (Future 
versions will have real shell extension support).</p>
<p>NetClip works great on Windows 95 as a local clipboard viewer. It requires Windows NT 4.0 to be able to view and modify the clipboard on 
another machine (at least until distributed COM is available on Windows 95 in late 1996).</p>
