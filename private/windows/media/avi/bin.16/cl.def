NAME 

;
; The NAME statement tells the linker that a Windows application is being
; built. The linker supplies the actual name of the application from the
; base name of the executable file. If a dynamic-link library (DLL) is being
; built the NAME statement should be replaced by a LIBARY statement.
;

EXETYPE        WINDOWS

;
; The EXETYPE statement tells the linker to build a Windows executable
; file.  This statement should be used in all applications built with
; Visual C++ for Windows.
;

CODE           PRELOAD MOVABLE DISCARDABLE
DATA           PRELOAD MOVABLE

;
; The CODE and DATA statements set the attributes of the applications CODE and
; DATA segments.
;

HEAPSIZE       1024
STACKSIZE      8096

;
; The HEAPSIZE and STACKSIZE statements set the applications near heap and
; stack sizes.  The values specified are recomended for QuickWin applications.

; The above section should be uncommented if this .DEF file is to be used as
; a model for a Visual C++ dynamic-link library (DLL) .DEF file. The WEP
; routine is included in the Visual C++ startup code, but the symbol must
; be explicitly exported. If a DLL already has a user-defined WEP routine,
; the routine should be renamed _WEP.  The startup code will call _WEP,
; if present, during DLL termination. For additional information concerning
; the WEP function, see the Visual C++ and Windows 3.1 SDK documentation.
