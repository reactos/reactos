A suitable Build Verification Test for Multi-Media

[NEW]
When the multimedia merge with USER and WINLOGON takes place this
new section will become effective.

Prereq: Ensure you have a sound capable machine with speakers/headphones
        - MIPS or x86 with Soundblaster or clone

        Ensure that WIN.INI [SOUNDS] section points SYSTEMWELCOME and
        SYSTEMSTART to a sound of your choice.

Boot:   When the Welcome (Press C-A-D) box appears the SYSTEMWELCOME sound
        should be played.

        When you logon successfully the SYSTEMSTART sound should be played.
        If at the logon panel an invalid key is pressed, e.g. Ctrl+Q, the
        SYSTEMHAND sound should play.
