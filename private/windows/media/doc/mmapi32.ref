.refpage auxSetVolume

WORD %auxSetVolume%(<wDeviceID>, <dwVolume>)

This function sets the volume in an auxiliary output device.

.parameters

WORD <wDeviceID>

    Identifies the auxiliary output device to be queried. Device IDs are
    determined implicitly from the number of devices present in the system.
    Device ID values range from zero to one less than the number of devices
    present. Use %auxGetNumDevs% to determine the number of auxiliary
    devices in the system.

DWORD <dwVolume>

    Specifies the new volume setting. The low-order word specifies the left
    channel volume setting, and the high-order word specifies the right
    channel setting. A value of 0xFFFF represents full volume, and a value
    of 0x0000 is silence.

    If a device does not support both left and right volume control, the
    low-order word of <dwVolume> specifies the volume level, and the
    high-order word is ignored.

.returns

Returns zero if the function was successful. Otherwise, it returns an error

Not all devices support volume control. To determine whether the device
supports volume control, use the AUXCAPS_VOLUME flag to test the %dwSupport%
field of the %AUXCAPS% structure (filled by %auxGetDevCaps%).

To determine whether the device supports volume control on both the left and
right channels, use the AUXCAPS_LRVOLUME flag to test the %dwSupport% field
of the %AUXCAPS% structure (filled by %auxGetDevCaps%).

Most devices do not support the full 16 bits of volume level control and
will use only the high-order bits of the requested volume setting. For
example, for a device that supports 4 bits of volume control, requested
volume level values of 0x4000, 0x4fff, and 0x43be will all produce the same
physical volume setting, 0x4000. The %auxGetVolume% function will return the
full 16-bit setting set with %auxSetVolume%.

Volume settings are interpreted logarithmically. This means the perceived
volume increase is the same when increasing the volume level from 0x5000 to
0x6000 as it is from 0x4000 to 0x5000.

This function resets the timestamps to zero; timestamp values for
subsequently received messages are relative to the time this function was
called.

All messages other than system exclusive messages are sent directly to the
client when received. System exclusive messages are placed in the buffers
supplied by %midiInAddBuffer%; if there are no buffers in the queue, the
data is thrown away without notification to the client, and input
continues.

Buffers are returned to the client when full, when a complete system
exclusive message has been received, or when %midiInReset% is called. The
%dwBytesRecorded% field in the header will contain the actual length of data
received.

Calling this function when input is already started has no effect, and the
function returns zero.

The %KEYARRAY% data type is defined as:

typedef WORD KEYARRAY[128];

Each element of the array represents one of the 128 key-based percussion
patches and has bits set for each of the 16 MIDI channels that use that
particular patch. The least-significant bit represents physical channel 0;
the most-significant bit represents physical channel 15. For example, if the
patch on key number 60 is used by physical channels 9 and 15, element 60
would be set to 0x8200.

This function applies only to internal MIDI synthesizer devices. Not all
internal synthesizers support patch caching. Use the MIDICAPS_CACHE flag to

MIDIMAPPER as the device ID to open the MIDI mapper.

If a window is chosen to receive callback information, the following
messages are sent to the window procedure function to indicate the progress
of MIDI output: %MM_MOM_OPEN%, %MM_MOM_CLOSE%, %MM_MOM_DONE%.

If a function is chosen to receive callback information, the following
messages are sent to the function to indicate the progress of MIDI output:
%MOM_OPEN%, %MOM_CLOSE%, %MOM_DONE%. The callback function must reside in a
DLL. You do not have to use %MakeProcInstance% to get a procedure-instance
address for the callback function.

.head "Callback"

void FAR PASCAL %MidiOutFunc%(<hMidiOut>, <wMsg>, <dwInstance>, <dwParam1>,

Not all devices support volume changes. To determine whether the device

To determine whether the device supports volume control on both the left and
right channels, use the MIDICAPS_LRVOLUME flag to test the %dwSupport% field
of the %MIDIOUTCAPS% structure (filled by %midiOutGetDevCaps%).

Most devices do not support the full 16 bits of volume level control and
will use only the high-order bits of the requested volume setting. For
example, for a device that supports 4 bits of volume control, requested
volume level values of 0x4000, 0x4fff, and 0x43be will all produce the same
physical volume setting, 0x4000. The %midiOutGetVolume% function will return
the full 16-bit setting set with %midiOutSetVolume%.

Volume settings are interpreted logarithmically. This means the perceived
increase in volume is the same when increasing the volume level from 0x5000
to 0x6000 as it is from 0x4000 to 0x5000.

.refpage mmioAdvance

MMRESULT %mmioAdvance%(<hmmio>, <lpmmioinfo>, <uFlags>)

This function advances the I/O buffer of a file set up for direct I/O buffer
access with %mmioGetInfo%. If the file is opened for reading, the I/O buffer
is filled from the disk. If the file is opened for writing and the
MMIO_DIRTY flag is set in the %dwFlags% field of the %MMIOINFO% structure,
the buffer is written to disk. The %pchNext%, %pchEndRead%, and
%pchEndWrite% fields of the %MMIOINFO% structure are updated to reflect the
new state of the I/O buffer.

.parameters

HMMIO <hmmio>

    Specifies the file handle for a file opened with %mmioOpen%.

LPMMIOINFO <lpmmioinfo>

    Specifies a pointer to the %MMIOINFO% structure obtained with
    %mmioGetInfo%.

UINT <uFlags>

    Specifies options for the operation. Contains exactly one of the
    following two flags:

MMIO_READ

    The buffer is filled from the file.

MMIO_WRITE

    The buffer is written to the file.

.returns

The return value is zero if the operation is successful. Otherwise, the
return value specifies an error code. The error code can be one of the
following codes:

MMIOERR_CANNOTWRITE

    The contents of the buffer could not be written to disk.

MMIOERR_CANNOTREAD

    An error occurred while re-filling the buffer.

MMIOERR_UNBUFFERED

    The specified file is not opened for buffered I/O.

MMIOERR_CANNOTEXPAND

    The specified memory file cannot be expanded, probably because the
    %adwInfo[0]% field was set to zero in the initial call to %mmioOpen%.

MMIOERR_OUTOFMEMORY

    There was not enough memory to expand a memory file for further
    writing.

.comments

If the specified file is opened for writing or for both reading and writing,
the I/O buffer will be flushed to disk before the next buffer is read. If
the I/O buffer cannot be written to disk because the disk is full, then
%mmioAdvance% will return MMIOERR_CANNOTWRITE.

If the specified file is only open for writing, the MMIO_WRITE flag must be
specified.

If you have written to the I/O buffer, you must set the MMIO_DIRTY flag in
the %dwFlags% field of the %MMIOINFO% structure before calling
%mmioAdvance%. Otherwise, the buffer will not be written to disk.

If the end of file is reached, %mmioAdvance% will still return success, even
though no more data can be read. Thus, to check for the end of the file, it
is necessary to see if the %pchNext% and %pchEndRead% fields of the
%MMIOINFO% structure are equal after calling %mmioAdvance%.

any).

If the chunk was created and descended into using %mmioCreateChunk%, or if
the MMIO_DIRTY flag is set in the %dwFlags% field of the %MMCKINFO%
structure referenced by <lpck>, then the current file position is assumed to
be the end of the data portion of the chunk. If the chunk size is not the
same as the value stored in the %cksize% field when %mmioCreateChunk% was
called, then %mmioAscend% corrects the chunk size in the file before
ascending from the chunk. If the chunk size is odd, %mmioAscend% writes a
null pad byte at the end of the chunk. After ascending from the chunk, the
current file position is the location following the end of the chunk (past
the extra pad byte, if any).

    The contents of the buffer could not be written to disk.

MMIOERR_CANNOTCLOSE

    The DOS file system failed to close the file.

Other error codes are possible depending on the IOProcedure installed

.refpage mmioCreateChunk

MMRESULT %mmioCreateChunk%(<hmmio>, <lpck>, <uFlags>)

This function creates a chunk in a RIFF file opened with %mmioOpen%. The new
chunk is created at the current file position. After the new chunk is
created, the current file position is the beginning of the data portion of
the new chunk.

.parameters

HMMIO <hmmio>

    Specifies the file handle of an open RIFF file.

LPMMCKINFO <lpck>

    Specifies a pointer to a caller-supplied %MMCKINFO% structure containing
    information about the chunk to be created. Set up the %MMCKINFO%
    structure as follows:

.blist
o   The %ckid% field specifies the chunk ID of the chunk. If <wFlags>
    includes MMIO_CREATERIFF or MMIO_CREATELIST, this field will be filled
    by %mmioCreateChunk%.

o   The %cksize% field specifies the size of the data portion of the chunk,
    including the form type or list type (if any). If this value is not
    correct when %mmioAscend% is called to mark the end of the chunk, them
    %mmioAscend% will correct the chunk size.

o   The %fccType% field specifies the form type or list type if the chunk is
    a "RIFF" or "LIST" chunk. If the chunk is not a "RIFF" or "LIST" chunk,
    this field need not be filled in.

o   The %dwDataOffset% field need not be filled in. The %mmioCreateChunk%
    function will fill this field with the file offset of the data portion
    of the chunk.

o   The %dwFlags% field need not be filled in. The %mmioCreateChunk%
    function will set the MMIO_DIRTY flag in %dwFlags%.
.endblist

UINT <uFlags>

    Specifies flags to optionally create either a "RIFF" chunk or a "LIST"
    chunk. Can contain one of the following flags:

MMIO_CREATERIFF

    Creates a "RIFF" chunk.

MMIO_CREATELIST

    Creates a "LIST" chunk.

.returns

The return value is zero if the function is successful. Otherwise, the
return value specifies an error code. The error code can be one of the
following codes:

MMIOERR_CANNOTWRITE

    Unable to write the chunk header.

MMIOERR_CANNOTSEEK

    Uanble to determine offset of data portion of the chunk.

.comments

This function cannot insert a chunk into the middle of a file. If a chunk is
created anywhere but the end of a file, %mmioCreateChunk% will overwrite
existing information in the file.

.refpage mmioDescend

MMRESULT %mmioDescend%(<hmmio>, <lpck>, <lpckParent>, <uFlags>)

This function descends into a chunk of a RIFF file opened with %mmioOpen%.
It can also search for a given chunk.

.parameters

HMMIO <hmmio>

    Specifies the file handle of an open RIFF file.

LPMMCKINFO <lpck>

    Specifies a pointer to a caller-supplied %MMCKINFO% structure that
    %mmioDescend% fills with the following information:

.blist
o   The %ckid% field is the chunk ID of the chunk.

o   The %cksize% field is the size of the data portion of the chunk. The
    data size includes the form type or list type (if any), but does not
    include the 8-byte chunk header or the pad byte at the end of the data
    (if any).

o   The %fccType% field is the form type if %ckid% is "RIFF", or the list
    type if %ckid% is "LIST". Otherwise, it is NULL.

o   The %dwDataOffset% field is the file offset of the beginning of the data
    portion of the chunk. If the chunk is a "RIFF" chunk or a "LIST" chunk,
    then %dwDataOffset% is the offset of the form type or list type.

o   The %dwFlags% contains other information about the chunk. Currently,
    this information is not used and is set to zero.
.endblist

    If the MMIO_FINDCHUNK, MMIO_FINDRIFF, or MMIO_FINDLIST flag is specified
    for <uFlags>, then the %MMCKINFO% structure is also used to pass
    parameters to %mmioDescend%:

.blist
o   The %ckid% field specifies the four-character code of the chunk ID, form
    type, or list type to search for.
.endblist

LPMMCKINFO <lpckParent>

    Specifies a pointer to an optional caller-supplied %MMCKINFO%
    structure identifying the parent of the chunk being searched for. A
    parent of a chunk is the enclosing chunk--only "RIFF" and "LIST" chunks
    can be parents. If <lpckParent> is not NULL, then %mmioDescend% assumes
    the %MMCKINFO% structure it refers to was filled when %mmioDescend% was
    called to descend into the parent chunk, and %mmioDescend% will only
    search for a chunk within the parent chunk. Set <lpckParent> to NULL if
    no parent chunk is being specified.

UINT <uFlags>

    Specifies search options. Contains up to one of the following flags. If
    no flags are specified, %mmioDescend% descends into the chunk beginning
    at the current file position.

MMIO_FINDCHUNK

    Searches for a chunk with the specified chunk ID.

MMIO_FINDRIFF

    Searches for a chunk with chunk ID "RIFF" and with the specified form
    type.

MMIO_FINDLIST

    Searches for a chunk with chunk ID "LIST" and with the specified form
    type.

.returns

The return value is zero if the function is successful. Otherwise, the
return value specifies an error code. If the end of the file (or the end of
the parent chunk, if given) is reached before the desired chunk is found,
the return value is MMIOERR_CHUNKNOTFOUND.  Other non-zero error returns
may be possible.

.comments

A RIFF chunk consists of a four-byte chunk ID (type FOURCC), followed by a
four-byte chunk size (type DWORD), followed by the data portion of the
chunk, followed by a null pad byte if the size of the data portion is odd.
If the chunk ID is "RIFF" or "LIST", the first four bytes of the data
portion of the chunk are a form type or list type (type FOURCC).

If %mmioDescend% is used to search for a chunk, the file position should be
at the beginning of a chunk before calling %mmioDescend%. The search begins
at the current file position and continues to the end of the file. If a
parent chunk is specified, the file position should be somewhere within the
parent chunk before calling %mmioDescend%. In this case, the search begins
at the current file position and continues to the end of the parent chunk.

If %mmioDescend% is unsuccessful in searching for a chunk, the current file
position is undefined. If %mmioDescend% is successful, the current file
position is changed. If the chunk is a "RIFF" or "LIST" chunk, the new file
position will be just after the form type or list type (12 bytes from the
beginning of the chunk). For other chunks, the new file position will be the
start of the data portion of the chunk (8 bytes from the beginning of the
chunk).

For efficient RIFF file I/O, use buffered I/O.

.refpage mmioFlush

MMRESULT %mmioFlush%(<hmmio>, <uFlags>)

This function writes the I/O buffer of a file to disk, if the I/O buffer has
been written to.

.parameters

HMMIO <hmmio>

    Specifies the file handle of a file opened with %mmioOpen%.

UINT <uFlags>

    Is not used and should be set to zero.

.returns

The return value is zero if the function is successful. Otherwise, the
return value specifies an error code. The error code can be one of the
following codes:

MMIOERR_CANNOTWRITE

    The contents of the buffer could not be written to disk.

.comments

Closing a file with %mmioClose% will automatically flush its buffer.

If there is insufficient disk space to write the buffer, %mmioFlush% will
fail, even if the preceding %mmioWrite% calls were successful.

.refpage mmioFOURCC

FOURCC %mmioFOURCC%(<ch0>, <ch1>, <ch2>, <ch3>)

This macro converts four characters to to a DWORD code.

.parameters

CHAR <ch0>

    The first character of the four-character code.

CHAR <ch1>

    The second character of the four-character code.

CHAR <ch2>

    The third character of the four-character code.

CHAR <ch3>

    The fourth character of the four-character code.

.returns

The return value is the DWORD representing the four character code
created from the given characters.

.comments

This macro does not check to see if the four character code follows any
conventions regarding which characters to include in a four-character code.

%mmioStringToFOURCC%

.refpage mmioGetInfo

MMRESULT %mmioGetInfo%(<hmmio>, <lpmmioinfo>, <uFlags>)

This function retrieves information about a file opened with %mmioOpen%.
This information allows the caller to directly access the I/O buffer, if the
file is opened for buffered I/O.

.parameters

HMMIO <hmmio>

    Specifies the file handle of the file.

LPMMIOINFO <lpmmioinfo>

    Specifies a pointer to a caller-allocated %MMIOINFO% structure that
    %mmioGetInfo% fills with information about the file. See the %MMIOINFO%
    structure and the %mmioOpen% function for information about the fields
    in this structure.

UINT <uFlags>

    Is not used and should be set to zero.

.returns

The return value is zero if the function is successful.

.comments

To directly access the I/O buffer of a file opened for buffered I/O, use the
following fields of the %MMIOINFO% structure filled by %mmioGetInfo%:

.blist
o   The %pchNext% field points to the next byte in the buffer that can be
    read or written. When you read or write, increment %pchNext% by the
    number of bytes read or written.

o   The %pchEndRead% field points to one byte past the last valid byte in
    the buffer that can be read.

o   The %pchEndWrite% field points to one byte past the last location in the
    buffer that can be written.
.endblist

Once you read or write to the buffer and modify %pchNext%, do not call any
MMIO function except %mmioAdvance% until you call %mmioSetInfo%. Call
%mmioSetInfo% when you are finished directly accessing the buffer.

When you reach the end of the buffer specified by %pchEndRead% or
%pchEndWrite%, call %mmioAdvance% to fill the buffer from the disk, or write
the buffer to the disk. The %mmioAdvance% function will update the
%pchNext%, %pchEndRead%, and %pchEndWrite% fields in the %MMIOINFO%
structure for the file.

Before calling %mmioAdvance% or %mmioSetInfo% to flush a buffer to disk, set
the MMIO_DIRTY flag in the %dwFlags% field of the %MMIOINFO% structure for
the file. Otherwise, the buffer will not get written to disk.

Do not decrement %pchNext% or modify any fields in the %MMIOINFO% structure
other than %pchNext% and %dwFlags%. Do not set any flags in %dwFlags% except
MMIO_DIRTY.

.refpage mmioInstallIOProc

LPMMIOPROC %mmioInstallIOProc%(<fccIOProc>, <pIOProc>, <dwFlags>)

This function installs or removes a custom I/O procedure. It will also
locate an installed I/O procedure, given its corresponding four-character
code.

.parameters

FOURCC <fccIOProc>

    Specifies a four-character code identifying the I/O procedure to
    install, remove, or locate. All characters in this four-character code
    should be uppercase characters.

LPMMIOPROC <pIOProc>

    Specifies the address of the I/O procedure to install. To remove or
    locate an I/O procedure, set this parameter to NULL.

DWORD <dwFlags>

    Specifies one of the following flags indicating whether the I/O
    procedure is being installed, removed, or located:

MMIO_INSTALLPROC

    Installs the specified I/O procedure.

MMIO_REMOVEPROC

    Removes the specified I/O procedure.

MMIO_FINDPROC

    Searches for the specified I/O procedure.

.returns

The return value is the address of the I/O procedure installed, removed, or
located. If there is an error, the return value is NULL.

.comments

If the I/O procedure resides in the application, for compatibility with the
16 bit windows API use %MakeProcInstance% to
get a procedure-instance address and specify this address for <pIOProc>. You
don't need to get a procedure-instance address if the I/O procedure resides
in a DLL.

.head "Callback"

LONG %IOProc%(<lpmmioinfo>, <wMsg>, <lParam1>, <lParam2>)

%IOProc% is a placeholder for the application-supplied function name. The
actual name must be exported by including it in a EXPORTS statement in the
application's module-definitions file.

%Parameters%

LPSTR <lpmmioinfo>

    Specifies a pointer to an %MMIOINFO% structure containing
    information about the open file. The I/O procedure must maintain the
    %lDiskOffset% field in this structure to indicate the file offset to the
    next read or write location. The I/O procedure can use the %adwInfo[]%
    field to store state information. The I/O procedure should not modify
    any other fields of the %MMIOINFO% structure.

UINT <uMsg>

    Specifies a message indicating the requested I/O operation. Messages
    that can be received include %MMIOM_OPEN%, %MMIOM_CLOSE%, %MMIOM_READ%,
    %MMIOM_WRITE%, and %MMIOM_SEEK%.

LONG <lParam1>

    Specifies a parameter for the message.

LONG <lParam2>

    Specifies a parameter for the message.

%Return Value%

The return value depends on the message specified by <wMsg>. If the I/O
procedure does not recognize a message, it should return zero.

%Comments%

The four-character code specified by the %fccIOProc% field in the %MMIOINFO%
structure associated with a file identifies a filename extension for a
custom storage system. When an application calls %mmioOpen% with a filename
like "foo.xyz!bar", the I/O procedure associated with the four-character
code "XYZ " is called to open the "bar" element of the file "foo.xyz".

The %mmioInstallIOProc% function maintains a separate list of installed I/O
procedures for each Windows application. Therefore, different applications
can use the same I/O procedure identifier for different I/O procedures
without conflict.

To share an I/O procedure among applications, the I/O procedure must reside
in a DLL called by each application using it. Each application using the
shared I/O procedure must call %mmioInstallIOProc% to install the procedure
(or call the DLL to install the procedure on behalf of the application).
Each application must call %mmioInstallIOProc% to remove the I/O procedure
before terminating.

If an application calls %mmioInstallIOProc% more than once to register the
same I/O procedure, then it must call %mmioInstallIOProc% to remove the
procedure once for each time it installed the procedure.

%mmioInstallIOProc% will not prevent an application from installing two
different I/O procedures with the same identifier, or installing an I/O
procedure with one of the predefined identifiers ("DOS ", "MEM ", or "BND
"). The most recently installed procedure takes precedence, and the most
recently installed procedure is the first one to get removed.

%mmioOpen%

.refpage mmioOpen

HMMIO %mmioOpen%(<szFilename>, <lpmmioinfo>, <dwOpenFlags>)

This function opens a file for unbuffered or buffered I/O. The file can be a
DOS file, a memory file, or an element of a custom storage system.

.parameters

LPSTR <szFilename>

    Specifies a pointer to a string containing the filename of the file
    to open. If no I/O procedure is specified to open the file, then the
    filename determines how the file is opened, as follows:

.blist
o   If the filename does not contain "+", then it is assumed to be the name
    of a DOS file.

o   If the filename is of the form "foo.ext+bar", then the extension "EXT "
    is assumed to identify an installed I/O procedure which is called to
    perform I/O on the file (see %mmioInstallIOProc%).

o   If the filename is NULL and no I/O procedure is given, then %adwInfo[0]%
    is assumed to be the DOS file handle of a currently open file.
.endblist

    The filename should not be longer than 128 bytes, including the
    terminating NULL.

    When opening a memory file, set <szFilename> to NULL.

LPMMIOINFO <lpmmioinfo>

    Specifies a pointer to an %MMIOINFO% structure containing extra
    parameters used by %mmioOpen%. Unless you are opening a memory file,
    specifying the size of a buffer for buffered I/O, or specifying an
    uninstalled I/O procedure to open a file, this parameter should be
    NULL.

    If <lpmmioinfo> is not NULL, all unused fields of the %MMIOINFO%
    structure it references must be set to zero, including the reserved
    fields.

DWORD <dwOpenFlags>

    Specifies option flags for the open operation. The MMIO_READ,
    MMIO_WRITE, and MMIO_READWRITE flags are mutually exclusive--only one
    should be specified. The MMIO_COMPAT, MMIO_EXCLUSIVE, MMIO_DENYWRITE,
    MMIO_DENYREAD, and MMIO_DENYNONE flags are DOS file-sharing flags, and
    can only be used after the DOS command SHARE has been executed.

MMIO_READ

    Opens the file for reading only. This is the default, if MMIO_WRITE and
    MMIO_READWRITE are not specified.

MMIO_WRITE

    Opens the file for writing. You should not read from a file opened in
    this mode.

MMIO_READWRITE

    Opens the file for both reading and writing.

MMIO_CREATE

    Creates a new file. If the file already exists, it is truncated to zero
    length. For memory files, MMIO_CREATE indicates the end of the file is
    initially at the start of the buffer.

MMIO_DELETE

    Deletes a file. If this flag is specified, <szFilename> should not be
    NULL. The return value will be TRUE (cast to HMMIO) if the file was
    deleted successfully, FALSE otherwise. Do not call %mmioClose% for a
    file that has been deleted. If this flag is specified, all other flags
    are ignored.

MMIO_ALLOCBUF

    Opens a file for buffered I/O. To allocate a buffer larger or smaller
    than the default buffer size (8K), set the %cchBuffer% field of the
    %MMIOINFO% structure to the desired buffer size. If %cchBuffer% is zero,
    then the default buffer size is used. If you are providing your own I/O
    buffer, then the MMIO_ALLOCBUF flag should not be used.

MMIO_COMPAT

    Opens the file with compatibility mode, allowing any process on a given
    machine to open the file any number of times. %mmioOpen% fails if the
    file has been opened with any of the other sharing modes.

MMIO_EXCLUSIVE

    Opens the file with exclusive mode, denying other processes both read
    and write access to the file. %mmioOpen% fails if the file has been
    opened in any other mode for read or write access, even by the current
    process.

MMIO_DENYWRITE

    Opens the file and denies other processes write access to the file.
    %mmioOpen% fails if the file has been opened in compatibility or for
    write access by any other process.

MMIO_DENYREAD

    Opens the file and denies other processes read access to the file.
    %mmioOpen% fails if the file has been opened in compatibility mode or
    for read access by any other process.

MMIO_DENYNONE

    Opens the file without denying other processes read or write access to
    the file. %mmioOpen% fails if the file has been opened in compatibility
    mode by any other process.

.returns

The return value is a handle to the opened file. This handle is not a DOS
file handle--do not use it with any file I/O functions other than MMIO
functions.

If the file cannot be opened, the return value is NULL. If <lpmmioinfo> is
not NULL, then its %wError% field will contain extended error information
returned by the I/O procedure.

.comments

If <lpmmioinfo> references an %MMIOINFO% structure, set up the fields as
described below. All unused fields must be set to zero, including reserved
fields.

.blist
o   To request that a file be opened with an installed I/O procedure, set
    the %fccIOProc% field to the four-character code of the I/O procedure,
    and set the %pIOProc% field to NULL.

o   To request that a file be opened with an uninstalled I/O procedure, set
    the %pIOProc% field to point to the I/O procedure, and set %fccIOProc%
    to NULL.

o   To request that %mmioOpen% determine which I/O procedure to use to open
    the file based on the filename contained in <szFilename>, set both
    %fccIOProc% and %pIOProc% to NULL. This is the default behavior if no
    %MMIOINFO% structure is specified.

o   To open a memory file using an internally allocated and managed buffer,
    set the %pchBuffer% field to NULL, %fccIOProc% to FOURCC_MEM,
    %cchBuffer% to the initial size of the buffer, and %adwInfo[0]% to the
    incremental expansion size of the buffer. This memory file will
    automatically be expanded in increments of %adwInfo[0]% bytes when
    necessary. Specify the MMIO_CREATE flag for the <dwOpenFlags> parameter
    to initially set the end of the file to be the beginning of the buffer.

o   To open a memory file using a caller-supplied buffer, set the
    %pchBuffer% field to point to the memory buffer, %fccIOProc% to
    FOURCC_MEM, %cchBuffer% to the size of the buffer, and %adwInfo[0]% to
    the incremental expansion size of the buffer. The expansion size in
    %adwInfo[0]% should only be non-zero if %pchBuffer% is a pointer
    obtained by calling %GlobalAlloc% and %GlobalLock%, since
    %GlobalReAlloc% will be called to expand the buffer. In particular, if
    %pchBuffer% points to a local or global array, a block of memory in the
    local heap, or a block of memory allocated by %GlobalDosAlloc%,
    %adwInfo[0]% must be zero.

    Specify the MMIO_CREATE flag for the <dwOpenFlags> parameter to
    initially set the end of the file to be the beginning of the buffer;
    otherwise, the entire block of memory will be considered readable.

o   To use a currently open DOS file handle with MMIO, set the %fccIOProc%
    field to FOURCC_DOS, %pchBuffer% to NULL, and %adwInfo[0]% to the DOS
    file handle. Note that offsets within the file will be relative to the
    beginning of the file, and will not depend on the DOS file position at
    the time %mmioOpen% is called; the initial MMIO offset will be the same
    as the DOS offset when %mmioOpen% is called. Later, to close the MMIO
    file handle without closing the DOS file handle, pass the MMIO_FHOPEN
    flag to %mmioClose%.
.endblist

You must call %mmioClose% to close a file opened with %mmioOpen%. Open files
are not automatically closed when an application exits.

.refpage mmioRead

LRESULT %mmioRead%(<hmmio>, <pch>, <cch>)

This function reads a specified number of bytes from a file opened with
%mmioOpen%.

.parameters

HMMIO <hmmio>

    Specifies the file handle of the file to be read.

LPSTR <pch>

    Specifies a pointer to a buffer to contain the data read from the
    file.

LONG <cch>

    Specifies the number of bytes to read from the file.

.returns

The return value is the number of bytes actually read. If the end of the
file has been reached and no more bytes can be read, the return value is
zero. If there is an error reading from the file, the return value is -1.

.comments

On 16 bit windows pch is a huge pointer.  On 32 bit windows there is no
distinction between huge poointers and long pointers.

%mmioWrite%

.refpage mmioSeek

LRESULT %mmioSeek%(<hmmio>, <lOffset>, <iOrigin>)

This function changes the current file position in a file opened with
%mmioOpen%. The current file position is the location in the file where data
is read or written.

.parameters

HMMIO <hmmio>

    Specifies the file handle of the file to seek in.

LONG <lOffset>

    Specifies an offset to change the file position.

int <iOrigin>

    Specifies how the offset specified by <lOffset> is interpreted. Contains
    one of the following flags:

SEEK_SET

    Seeks to <lOffset> bytes from the beginning of the file.

SEEK_CUR

    Seeks to <lOffset> bytes from the current file position.

SEEK_END

    Seeks to <lOffset> bytes from the end of the file.

.returns

The return value is the new file position in bytes, relative to the
beginning of the file. If there is an error, the return value is -1.

.comments

Seeking to an invalid location in the file, such as past the end of the
file, may fail to cause %mmioSeek% to return an error, but may cause subsequent
I/O operations on the file to fail.

To locate the end of a file, call %mmioSeek% with <lOffset> set to zero and
 <iOrigin> set to SEEK_END.

.refpage mmioSendMessage

LRESULT %mmioSendMessage%(<hmmio>, <uMsg>, <lParam1>, <lParam2>)

This function sends a message to the I/O procedure associated with the
specified file.

.parameters

HMMIO <hmmio>

    Specifies the file handle for a file opened with %mmioOpen%.

UINT <uMsg>

    Specifies the message to send to the I/O procedure.

LONG <lParam1>

    Specifies a parameter for the message.

LONG <lParam2>

    Specifies a parameter for the message.

.returns

The return value depends on the message. If the I/O procedure does not
recognize the message, the return value is zero.

.comments

Use this function to send custom user-defined messages. Do not use it to
send the %MMIOM_OPEN%, %MMIOM_CLOSE%, %MMIOM_READ%, %MMIOM_WRITE%,
%MMIOM_WRITEFLUSH%, or %MMIOM_SEEK% messages. Define custom messages to be
greater than or equal to the MMIOM_USER constant.

.refpage mmioSetBuffer

MMRESULT %mmioSetBuffer%(<hmmio>, <pchBuffer>, <cchBuffer>, <uFlags>)

This function enables or disables buffered I/O, or changes the buffer or
buffer size for a file opened with %mmioOpen%.

.parameters

HMMIO <hmmio>

    Specifies the file handle of the file.

LPSTR <pchBuffer>

    Specifies a pointer to a caller-supplied buffer to use for buffered
    I/O. If NULL, %mmioSetBuffer% allocates an internal buffer for buffered
    I/O.

LONG <cchBuffer>

    Specifies the size of the caller-supplied buffer, or the size of the
    buffer for %mmioSetBuffer% to allocate.

UINT <uFlags>

    Is not used and should be set to zero.

.returns

The return value is zero if the function is successful. Otherwise, the
return value specifies an error code. If an error occurs, the file handle
remains valid. The error code can be one of the following codes:

MMIOERR_CANNOTWRITE

    The contents of the old buffer could not be written to disk, so the
    operation was aborted.

MMIOERR_OUTOFMEMORY

    The new buffer could not be allocated, probably due to a lack of
    available memory.

.comments

To enable buffering using an internal buffer, set <pchBuffer> to NULL and
 <cchBuffer> to the desired buffer size.

To supply your own buffer, set <pchBuffer> to point to the buffer, and set
 <cchBuffer> to the size of the buffer.

To disable buffered I/O, set <pchBuffer> to NULL and <cchBuffer> to zero.

If buffered I/O is already enabled using an internal buffer, you can
reallocate the buffer to a different size by setting <pchBuffer> to NULL and
 <cchBuffer> to the new buffer size. The contents of the buffer may be
changed after resizing.

.refpage mmioSetInfo

MMRESULT %mmioSetInfo%(<hmmio>, <lpmmioinfo>, <uFlags>)

This function updates the information retrieved by %mmioGetInfo% about a

.refpage sndPlaySound

BOOL %sndPlaySound%(<lpszSoundName>, <wFlags>)

This function plays a waveform sound specified by a filename or by an entry
in the [sounds] section of WIN.INI. If the sound can't be found, it plays
the default sound specified by the SystemDefault entry in the [sounds]
section of WIN.INI. If there is no SystemDefault entry or if the default
sound can't be found, the function makes no sound and returns FALSE.

.parameters

LPSTR <lpszSoundName>

    Specifies the name of the sound to play. The function searches the
    [sounds] section of WIN.INI for an entry with this name and plays the
    associated waveform file. If no entry by this name exists, then it
    assumes the name is the name of a waveform file. If this parameter is
    NULL, any currently playing sound is stopped.

WORD <wFlags>

    Specifies options for playing the sound using one or more of the
    following flags:

SND_SYNC

    The sound is played synchronously and the function does not return until
    the sound ends.

SND_ASYNC

    The sound is played asynchronously and the function returns immediately
    after beginning the sound. To terminate an asynchronously-played sound,
    call %sndPlaySound% with <lpszSoundName> set to NULL.

SND_NODEFAULT

    If the sound can't be found, the function returns silently without
    playing the default sound.

SND_MEMORY

    The parameter specified by <lpszSoundName> points to an in-memory image
    of a waveform sound.

SND_LOOP

    The sound will continue to play repeatedly until %sndPlaySound% is
    called again with the <lpszSoundName> parameter set to NULL. You must
    also specify the SND_ASYNC flag to loop sounds.

SND_NOSTOP

    If a sound is currently playing, the function will immediately return
    FALSE without playing the requested sound.

.returns

Returns TRUE if the sound is played, otherwise returns FALSE.

.comments

The sound must fit in available physical memory and be playable by an
installed waveform audio device driver. The directories searched for sound
files are, in order: the current directory; the Windows directory; the
Windows system directory; the directories listed in the PATH environment
variable; the list of directories mapped in a network. See the Windows
%OpenFile% function for more information about the directory search order.

If you specify the SND_MEMORY flag, <lpszSoundName> must point to an
in-memory image of a waveform sound. If the sound is stored as a resource,
use %LoadResource% and %LockResource% to load and lock the resource and get
a pointer to it. If the sound is not a resource, you must use %GlobalAlloc%
with the GMEM_MOVEABLE and GMEM_SHARE flags set and then %GlobalLock% to
allocate and lock memory for the sound.

.refpage timeGetTime

DWORD %timeGetTime%()

This function retrieves the system time in milliseconds. The system time is
the time elapsed since Windows was started.

.parameters

None

.returns

The return value is the system time in milliseconds.

.comments

The only difference between this function and the %timeGetSystemTime%
function is %timeGetSystemTime% uses the standard multimedia time structure
%MMTIME% to return the system time. The %timeGetTime% function has less
overhead than %timeGetSystemTime%.

.seealso

%timeSetEvent%

.refpage timeSetEvent

WORD %timeSetEvent%(<wDelay>, <wResolution>, <lpFunction>, <dwUser>,
 <wFlags>)

This function sets up a timed callback event. The event can be a one-time
event or a periodic event. Once activated, the event calls the specified
callback function.

.parameters

WORD <wDelay>

    Specifies the event period in milliseconds. If the delay is less than
    the minimum period supported by the timer, or greater than the maximum
    period supported by the timer, the function returns an error.

WORD <wResolution>

    Specifies the accuracy of the delay in milliseconds. The resolution of
    the timer event increases with smaller <wResolution> values. To reduce
    system overhead, use the maximum <wResolution> value appropriate for
    your application.

LPTIMECALLBACK <lpFunction>

    Specifies the procedure address of a callback function that is called
    once upon expiration of a one-shot event or periodically upon expiration
    of periodic events.

DWORD <dwUser>

    Contains user-supplied callback data.

WORD <wFlags>

    Specifies the type of timer event, using one of the following flags:

TIME_ONESHOT

    Event occurs once, after <wPeriod> milliseconds.

TIME_PERIODIC

    Event occurs every <wPeriod> milliseconds.

.returns

Returns an ID code that identifies the timer event. Returns NULL if the
timer event was not created. The ID code is also passed to the callback
function.

.comments

Using this function to generate a high-frequency periodic-delay event (with
a period less than 10 milliseconds) can consume a significant portion of the
system CPU bandwidth. Any call to %timeSetEvent% for a periodic-delay timer
must be paired with a call to %timeKillEvent%.

The callback function must reside in a DLL. You don't have to use
%MakeProcInstance% to get a procedure-instance address for the callback
function.

.head "Callback"

void FAR PASCAL %TimeFunc%(<wID>, <wMsg>, <dwUser>, <dw1>, <dw2>)

%TimeFunc% is a placeholder for the application-supplied function name. The
actual name must be exported by including it in the EXPORTS statement of the
module-definition file for the DLL.

Use %waveOutGetNumDevs% to determine the number of waveform output devices
present in the system. The device ID specified by <wDeviceID> varies from
zero to one less than the number of devices present.

The %WAVEFORMAT% structure pointed to by <lpFormat> may be extended to
include type-specific information for certain data formats. For example, for
PCM data, an extra WORD is added to specify the number of bits per sample.
Use the %PCMWAVEFORMAT% structure in this case.

If a window is chosen to receive callback information, the following
messages are sent to the window procedure function to indicate the progress
of waveform output: %MM_WOM_OPEN%, %MM_WOM_CLOSE%, %MM_WOM_DONE%

If a function is chosen to receive callback information, the following
messages are sent to the function to indicate the progress of waveform
output: %WOM_OPEN%, %WOM_CLOSE%, %WOM_DONE%. The callback function must
reside in a DLL. You do not have to use %MakeProcInstance% to get a
procedure-instance address for the callback function.

.head "Callback"

void FAR PASCAL %WaveOutFunc%(<hWaveOut>, <wMsg>, <dwInstance>, <dwParam1>,
 <dwParam2>)

%WaveOutFunc% is a placeholder for the application-supplied function name.
The actual name must be exported by including it in an EXPORTS statement in
the DLL's module- definition file.

%Parameters%

HWAVEOUT <hWaveOut>

    Specifies a handle to the waveform device associated with the callback.

WORD <wMsg>

    Specifies a waveform output message.

DWORD <dwInstance>

    Specifies the user instance data specified with %waveOutOpen%.

DWORD <dwParam1>

    Specifies a parameter for the message.

DWORD <dwParam2>

    Specifies a parameter for the message.

%Comments%

Because the callback is accessed at interrupt time, it must reside in a DLL
and its code segment must be specified as FIXED in the module-definition
file for the DLL. Any data that the callback accesses must be in a FIXED
data segment as well. The callback may not make any system calls except for
%PostMessage%, %timeGetSystemTime%, %timeGetTime%, %timeSetEvent%,
%timeKillEvent%, %midiOutShortMsg%, %midiOutLongMsg%, and %OutputDebugStr%.

Not all devices support volume changes. To determine whether the device

To determine whether the device supports volume control on both the left and
right channels, use the WAVECAPS_LRVOLUME flag flag to test the %dwSupport%
field of the %WAVEOUTCAPS% structure (filled by %waveOutGetDevCaps%).

Most devices don't support the full 16 bits of volume level control and will
not use the high-order bits of the requested volume setting. For example,
for a device that supports 4 bits of volume control, requested volume level
values of 0x4000, 0x4fff, and 0x43be all produce the same physical volume
setting, 0x4000. The %waveOutGetVolume% function returns the full 16-bit
setting set with %waveOutSetVolume%.

Volume settings are interpreted logarithmically. This means the perceived
increase in volume is the same when increasing the volume level from 0x5000
to 0x6000 as it is from 0x4000 to 0x5000.
