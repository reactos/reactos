;
; This file defines the base virtual address for Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL)
; that are part of the Windows NT System.  The first token on a line is the name
; of the DLL and the second token is the base virtual address, in hexidecimal.
; The third token is the maximum size of the DLL image file, including symbols.
;
;  NOTE:  I have used the convention of labelling unused areas as _FREExx_.
;  If you need an address,  these are available.  They were used by printer
;  drivers.
