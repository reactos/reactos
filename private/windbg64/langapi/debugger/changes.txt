	od.h:
		Added msgMaskNone and reversed two values for consistency with
		the IDE's UI.

21-Sep-1993 MikeMo
	od.h
		Stuff for stepping across OLE Remote Procedure Calls.

06-Aug-1993 MikeMo
	od.h
		Post-mortem debugging (OSDDebugActive).

11-May-1993 MikeMo
	od.h
		Removed lpfnGetMsg -- due to other changes, it's not necessary
		after all.

06-May-1993 MikeMo
	od.h
		cuda#3652: added lpfnGetMsg to the DBF structure, so that OSDebug
		can use a GetMsg function supplied by the debugger.

04-May-1993 MikeMo
    od.h
        Added xosdLoadAborted, which is the error code returned by
        the NT DM's dmfProgLoad if the user does a Stop Debuggging
        before the debuggee has finished loading.

03-May-1993 RicoM
    cvinfo.h
        CV_TYP_IS_UNSIGNED(typ) no longer includes T_RCHAR as an unsigned
        primitive type CV_TYP_IS_SIGNED(typ) still does though (after all
        T_RCHAR can't be both signed AND unsigned...

22-Apr-1993 MikeMo
    od.h
        Added another function pointer to the DBF structure:
        lpfnDispatchMsg points to a function in the debugger which will
        dispatch a message.  This is needed if the TL or DM has to run
        a message pump (as the NT DM does): since OSDebug doesn't know
        what special processing the debugger may want to do with the
        message, we now pass down this pointer.

        lpfnDispatchMsg takes an LPVOID argument, and what it points to
        depends on what version of OSDebug is being built.  For the NT
        version, this is an LPMSG.

17-Apr-1993 MikeMo
    od.h
        Added xosdDLLNotFound, which is needed for NT.

13-Apr-1993 MikeMo
    od.h
        Added mtrcMaxSuspend, which returns the maximum suspend count of
        a process or thread in the target OS.  For some environments, this
        may be 0 (such as DOS) or 1 (such as OS/2).  For NT, this happens
        to be 127.

12-Apr-1993 DanS
    types.h
        use std CRT names instead of oldnames for WIN32

02-Apr-1993 MikeMo
    od.h
        Changed the TState field of a TST (thread state): removed
        the TRC_C_Suspended value (since you can tell if it's suspended
        by checking dwSuspendCount), and added the TRC_C_FirstChance
        value to determine if the thread is currently processing a
        first-chance exception.

01-Apr-1993 MikeMo
    od.h
        Moved private EXOP fields out of this structure, into EXOPE
        (which is defined inside OSDebug).

        Added stoPassEx, so that when doing a step you can indicate
        whether to pass a first-chance exception on to the debuggee.
        This is directly orthogonal to exop.fGoException.

24-Mar-1993 MikeMo
    od.h
        Added xosdAllThreadsSuspended, which is returned as a dbcError
        if the debugger does Go, Step, etc. when all debuggee threads
        are suspended.

23-Mar-1993 DanS
    cvinfo.h
    cvexefmt.h
        cleanup from RossG, added ALPHA processor identifiers.

22-Mar-1993 MikeMo
    od.h
        Now instead of OSDHandleEx taking a BOOL fHandle, it takes
        an EFD which indicates whether the DM should ignore the
        exception, notify the debugger of it and keep running, or
        stop the debuggee.

22-Mar-1993 MarkBro
    cvinfo.h:
        Changed field in lfOEM struct from OEM to cvOEM.  The OEM 
        field conflicted with #defines in OEM (DBCS) versions of
        CodeView.

21-Mar-1993 MikeMo
    od.h
        Enhancements to exception support:
        (1) Added mtrcFirstChanceExc, which indicates whether the
            target OS supports first-chance exceptions.
        (2) dbcException's wParam now consists of two bitfields:
            excFirstChance is set if this is a first-chance exception
            (if the target OS doesn't support first-chance exceptions
            then this will never be set); and excContinuing is set
            if OSDebug is continuing to run the debuggee despite
            receiving the exception (this will never be set for
            last-chance exceptions).

16-Mar-1993 MikeMo
    od.h
        Revised TST (Thread State) to be a more OS-independent
        (although it's still not completely OS-independent).

05-Mar-1993 MikeMo
    od.h
        Minor change: added bpnsMax, upper-limit value for BPNS enum

25-Feb-1993 MikeMo
    od.h
        Added some fields to the RT (Register Type) enumeration to
        allow the debugger to determine if a particular register
        is used as part of the program counter, base pointer,
        stack pointer, and/or flags.

        The new flags (rtPC, rtBase, rtStack, and rtFlags) are to
        be used to determine if a given register is used for a
        given purpose, e.g. to determine if a register is (part
        of) the program counter.  You shouldn't use these to
        calculate, for example, the program counter, because the
        PC may be calculated in an unusual way (e.g. CS:EIP).

        Each register can have zero or more of these set (e.g. the
        SS register will have rtBase and rtStack).  Each of these
        flags can be set on zero or more registers (e.g. the rtPC
        flag will be set for the CS, IP, and EIP registers).

09-Feb-1993 MikeMo
    od.h
        Some of the RT (Register Type) fields were not bitfields
        before.  This wasn't a bug in itself, but it made it more
        likely that someone writing a debugger would introduce
        bugs because they might not realize that the fields weren't
        bitfields.  Now all RT fields are bitfields.

29-Jan-1993 MikeMo
    od.h
        Added dopHexUpper, for upper-case hex digits.  We already
        had dopUpper, but that converts everything; in some cases
        we will want lower case disassembly but with upper case
        hex digits.  (If caller sets dopUpper, then dopHexUpper is
        also implied.)

15-Jan-1993 MikeMo
    od.h
        Removed dbcThreadDestroy, which was a bogus duplicate of
        dbcDeleteThread.

13-Jan-1993 MikeMo
    Removed osdHandleEx, since instead you're supposed to use
    OSDHandleEx().

04-Dec-1992 MikeMo
    Since the CRT printf routines return "int", the return types for
    the EE's prototypes for eprintf and sprintf have been changed
    from "short" to "int".

30-Nov-1992 MikeMo
    types.h
        Moved "#define WNDPROC FARPROC" inside the section that only
        gets evaluated if <windows.h> has NOT been included.  (It
        doesn't seem to me that this should be needed at all, but I'm
        leaving it just in case.)

24-Nov-1992 MikeMo
    od.h
        Moved some debug modes (dbm's) here from dmwin\dmw0.c, where
        they had previously been hardcoded.

29-Oct-1992 MikeMo
    od.h
        The TST structure used to be in stump\emp.hmd, but it's a
        public structure (filled in by osdThreadStat), so I moved it
        to od.h

28-Oct-1992 MikeMo
    types.h
        For HOST32: PASCAL = __stdcall, CDECL = _cdecl, so as to match
        the NT header files.
    cvtypes.h
        Added EXPCALL, calling convention to be used for exported
        functions (PASCAL on most systems, CDECL on NT & Win32s).
    od.h
    shapi.h
    eeapi.h
        Exported functions now use EXPCALL calling convention.

15-Oct-1992 MikeMo
    CVINC project created.
