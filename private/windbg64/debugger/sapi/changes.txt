    Has it been this long?  Merge in the speed changes from SteveSm for faster UDT lookups.
    Rename all the VC sourcecode to *.vc.  We'll eliminate them all together shortly.
    Rename the NT .cxx files to *.cpp.
    Switch to the NT build process.
    Move the tracking for the PDATA and FPO into the EXE struct.  This allows multiple
    copies of the same image for different processes.

16-Jun-1995
    loadomf.cpp
        Query the registry for Pdb Dirs and pass information to mspdb?0.dll, so it
        can search for pdbs along the path.

01-May-1995 SanjayS
    shsymlb0.c
        Don't search the publics in SHdNearestSymbol if the address passed in
        lies within the range of the proc that we found.

25-Feb-1995 BryanT
    Nuke all 16-bit files and build rules.  Use the Dolphin/Crystal codebase if it's
    interesting to you.

03-Nov-1994 BryanT
    All *.cxx files, sources, shinc.hxx
        Add support to build in NT build environment w/o effecting VC.
        *.cxx files are built in NT, *.c are built for VC (will change
        once it's stable).  For NT code, remove FAR/PASCAL/LOADDS/NEAR
        macros.  Replace _ftcsxxx macros with _tcsxxx macros.  Remove
        need for shwin32.c by using CRITICAL_SECTION wrappers.  Format
        according to OSDebug4 standards.

23-Jun-1994 SanjayS
    loadomf.cpp
        Add support to read NT .dbg files.

18-May-1994 v-LeoL
    loadomf.cpp inc\sapi.h
        When the IDE preloads a DLL it stands the risk of NT moving the
        loadaddress when loaded for real. This causes all the
        IMAGE_RUNTIME_FUNCTION_ENTRY's to be invalid unless relocated.
        So OLLoadOmf is changed to check for that problem and LoadPdata
        stores the assumed loadaddress when first loaded.

18-May-1994 MarkBro
    shsymbol.c:
        Corrected CheckHandles.  It assumed that psym->off was never zero.
        Changed all refs from
            GetAddrOff(paddr) == 0
        to
            GetAddrOff(paddr) < psym->off

        Also corrected SHIsInProlog to correctly check for the end (limit)
        when validating epilog.

29-Apr-1994 MarkBro
    shinit.c:
        Exported SHIsEmiLoaded.

29-Apr-1994 MarkBro
    sh.c:
        In SHAddDllExt, when a filename isn't found in the correct
        list, look in the other list (exgDll vs. exgExe).  If found
        put in correct list.  Solves problem with calling SHLoadDll
        which automatically puts filename into dll list (doesn't
        take an arg to specify)

25-Apr-1994 v-LeoL
    shsymbol.c
        Because MIPS uses nested procedures in C++EH and SEH do an
        exhaustive search in SetBlks when PC is beyond DebugEnd of
        top level procedure.

20-Apr-1994 SanjayS
    sh.c
        Store full path name for dlls we don't find on the host machine.
        This is so we don't report errors during a restart.

19-Apr-1994 v-LeoL
    shsymbol.c
        Protect against GetSymbols failure and prep for S_LINK32
        support
    sl.c
        Protect against FHOpen failure
    sh.c
        Protect SHGetHexeName against null Hexe

14-Apr-1994 MarkBro
    sh.c:
        When destroying an Exs node, make sure that the
        find node succeeded before calling LLRemove

13-Apr-1994 v-LeoL
    shsymbol.c
        return FALSE in SHIsInProlog if addr beyond end of proc

1-Apr-1994 v-LeoL
    sh.c shsymbol.c
        Don't stop for S_ENDARG when looking for REGREL/BPREL
        Look for REGREL in SHGetSymbol sopStack

30-Mar-1994 MarkBro
    sl.c:
        Big changes to SLFAddrFromLineExtended. Removed cache and
        now will loop through entire source table to find multiple
        occurances of a line w/i the table.

        SLFLineToAddr now has its own cache for the previous query.
        (SLCAddrFromLine already had a cache).

        SLCAddrFromLine now calls SLFAFLExt with new arg for finding
        the nth entry in the specified table

24-Mar-1994
    loadomf.cpp
        Under OSDEBUG4X don't exit OLStart if DEBUG_DIRECTORY==NULL
        until after having checked/loaded pdata

22-Mar-1994 MarkBro
    shinit.c shsymbol.c shiproto.h:
        Added export of SHFindSymInExe

17-Mar-1994 MarkBro
    Changes below to fix Dolphin 8654.

    loadomf.c:
        #ifdef'd out guts of LoadOmap since it will do an allocation
        which isn't saved.  Basicall, lost memory

    sh.c:
        Reworked SHUnloadSymbolhandler.  Now correctly destroy debug
        data lists.  Also takes an arg to deterimine if the DLL
        is actually being unloaded or just the debuggee.

        Various KillxxxList functions now free up corresponding
        memory.  Still some holes, but not so bad.  The problems
        were mostly lists being retained.  Not anymore

    shinit.c:
        Change SHInit call of InitLlexg to FInitLists and now include
        initializing hlliPds

    inc\shiproto.h:
        Changed prototype for SHUnloadSymbolHandler (now takes BOOL)

15-Mar-1994 MarkBro
    sh.c:
        When loading symbols, don't put cbSym into WORD.  Should go
        into UINT.  Dolphin 8577

18-Feb-1994 MarkBro
    loadomf.c:
        Close the hfile (.exe/.dll) if NB10 and LoadPdb fails.
        Dolphin:3386

16-Feb-1994 MarkBro
    *.c inc\sapi.h:
        Dbcs enabling only.

18-Jan-1994 MikeMo
    shsymbol.c inc\cvproto.h:
        OSDebug 4 changes: SYFIsOverlayLoaded callback is gone.

30-Nov-1993 MarkBro
    ph.c:
        Enabled NB09 FindNearest to search global syms also.  SteveSm
        vehemently argueed not to put in additional support for NB10

12-Nov-1993 MarkBro
    loadomf.c dosdll.asm shinit.c sh.c inc\shiproto.h inc\sapi.h:
        Handle PDB load errors like NB09 errors and added new
        function void SHPdbNameFromExe( lszName, lszPdbName, cbMax )

4-Nov-1993 MarkBro
    sl.c:
        When calculating the CB for the last line in the source line
        table, add 1 to the offEnd since GetSFBounds returns an
        inclusive offset so cb = offBounds - srcstart + 1:
        Fix for dolphin 3701

2-Nov-1993 MarkBro
    ph.c:
        Added code in FindNearest to include sstGlobals in search
        ifdef'd out until M5

    shsymlb0.c:
        When getting nearest address, also allow for GDATAxx when
        creating strings.

21-Oct-1993 MarkBro
    shinit.c sh.c inc\shiproto.h dosdll.asm:
        Added SHUnloadSymbolHandler for NB10 notifications.  Can
        also be used in the future to free up memory so symbol
        handler doesn't need to be free'd and reloaded.

7-Oct-1993 MarkBro
    loadomf.c:
        OLLoadFileIndexes - handle NB10 pdb size instead of lpdssCur->cb

6-Oct-1993 MarkBro
    loadomf.c:
        OLLoadFileIndexes - correct off by 1 on cbFileName calculation

5-Oct-1993 MarkBro
    inc\sapi.h:
        Added cbFileNames field to _EXS struct.  This will be used
        to determine the end of the lpchFileNames buffer.

    loadomf.c:
        OLLoadFileIndexes - initialize the cbFileNames field of the _EXS
        struct

    sl.c:
        Added SLFFileInHexe.  Scans lpchFileNames for a specific file
        being searched for in SLCAddrFromLine.  Also changed SLCAddrFromLine
        to call SLFFileInHexe to short circuit and NOT go through all of
        the modules in an exe if the file isn't referenced in the exe

1-Oct-1993 MarkBro
    sl.c:
        cbLine was off by 1.  (offNext - offPrev - 1) was the cb in
        SLFLineToAddrExtended.  All the way from CV400!

29-Sep-1993 v-LeoL
    loadomf.c:
        Handle uSig == 8 in CheckSignature

    ph.c
        Add UNALIGNED for MIPS

    shsymbol.c shsymlb0.c shsymlb1.c
        Add support for S_GPROCMIPS, S_LPROCMIPS, S_REGREG32

27-Sep-1993 MarkBro
    sl.c:
        Corrected bug in SLFLineToAddrExtended.  Improperly caching
        iSegStartSave.

21-Sep-1993 MarkBro
    sh.c:
        Corrected SHHexeAddNew to first check the exs list to see
        if the hexg is already in the list if so, don't re-add (bug)
        and return success.

    shsymbol.c inc\sapi.h:
        DBCS enabling.  Missing call to STRLWR instead of _fstrlwr

    sl.c:
        Changed SLCAddrFromLine to go through each segment table for
        a source file.  Also SLFLineToAddr now calls SLFLineToAddrExteneded
        which SLCAddrFromLine uses.  This new API (not exported) takes
        an index into the hsf (SL table) to start the search for the line.

08-Sep-1993 MarkBro
    sl.c:
        Added SLCAddrFromLine.  This will walk through all of the hexe's
        in our list to get ALL occurances of a source line in all modules.
        Will allocate an array of SLP (source line pairs)

    shinit.c:
        Added export of SLCAddrFromLine to the SHF struct.  Also added new
        SHFree so caller can free up memory allocated by SLCAddrFromLine

    inc\shiproto.h:
        Added prototype for SLCAddrFromLine

26-May-1993 DanS
    sh.c
        cuda:4825
        GetNextSym and FixAlign were not operating on the same wavelength
        wrt UFOP's and what was stored in the data portion of S_ALIGN records
        once we had the page loaded.
    ph.c
    sh.c
        turn optimizations on for WIN32 builds

20-Apr-1993 RicoM
    ph.c
        CUDA #3513
        PsymFromRef now returns NULL if the module in question doesn't
        have any associated symbols.  There was only one call to this
        function and it now correctly checks for this case.  This fixes
        problems that occur if cvpack can't write out the symbols for
        a module because they are too big or some other such wierdness.

23-Mar-1993 DanS
    shsymbol.c
    shsymlb0.c
        changes required by new cvinfo.h, use bitfields instead of hard
        coded bit positions.

19-Mar-1993 dans
    shsymbol.c
        don't count on proc symbols being ordered by offset in SHSetBlksInCXT.
        this means that we have to look at every proc sym in a module before
        giving up.

16-Mar-1993 dans
    sh.c
        a couple of off-by-1 bugs in LpvFromAlmLfo regarding cb == cbBlock
        on an ending alignment record that is on the boundary, exactly.
        Also fixed a couple of warnings.

05-Mar-1993 dans
    makefile
    sh.c
    shinit.c
    shnt.bld
        added critical sections around SHLoadDll and SHAddDll, cause they
        both dork with the list of modules.

29-Feb-1993
    loadomf.c
        Change cTypeIndChunk to 0x2000 to prevent wrap-around when loading
        type index table in a segmented architecture.
    shsymbol.c
    shsymlb0.c
    shsymlb1.c
        Added S_[L|G]Thread cases where appropriate in order to support
        thread local storage.

31-Dec-1992 RicoM
    sh.c:
        Check for null hpds in SHGetNextExe() and return failure code
        instead of asserting

17-Dec-1992 MarkBro
    shw0.bld:
        Fix version stuff in windows builds.

15-Dec-1992 MarkBro
    shsymbol.c:
        Moved assert( pcxt->hmod ) in SHGetSymLoc to places where
        hmod is referenced.  There are places where we don't care if the
        hmod is null (where it's not used, duh).

11-Dec-1992 MarkBro
    shsymbol.c:
        SHGetSymLoc wasn't handling multiple register symbols.  Needed
        to see if register index > 255.  Second register value to be
        in hiword if applicable

11-Dec-1992 MarkBro
    shinit.c
        Change #ifdef around version stuff so we can get update version #'s
        for release builds.

07-Dec-1992 MarkBro
    sh.c:
        Add extra check for end of symbol info in GetNextSym.  Was only
        checking for ~1.  Now check for ~1 or -1.

05-Dec-1992 MarkBro
    sh.c:
        Allow SHHexeFromHmod to accept an HMOD of NULL.  If the hmod is
        NULL, return (HEXE)NULL.

03-Dec-1992 GlennN
    ph.c
        fix bug 5859.
        Add function to verify an hexe from an hpid.
        The problem was that we assume that hpdsCurr is
        changed and since we changed to having 1 hpds we
        lost the ability to cache multiple hpids ( as well
        as the setting of hpidCurr ).  To get around this (
        since windows is weird ) we now make sure that the
        hexe is an hexe in the list.

    loadomf.c
        added fix from dans change to OLLoadOmf

02-Dec-1992 DavidGra
    ph.c
        Incorporate DanS's fix for binary searching.
    inc\sapi.h
    sh.c
    loadomf.c
        Handle mis-aligned symbols by maintaining an align bit in
        the Alm structure and using the low bit of an alignment
        record length to maintain the alignment bit for linear
        searching of tables.

30-Nov-1992 MikeMo
    loadomf.c:
        (1) In default (non-LOADALL) case, skip over all sstModules
            as an optimization.  (This was already being done in
            the LOADALL case.)
        (2) Fix for NT: compare iMod to 0xFFFF not -1, since it's an
            unsigned short.  (Was fixed earlier, someone accidentally
            changed it back on a merge with 410.)

24-Nov-1992 DavidGra
    loadomf.c
    ph.c
    inc\sapi.h
        Added support for hash functions 10 & 12 while still supporting
        functions 6 & 8.

18-Nov-1992 DavidGra
    sl.c:
        If a source line table is unsorted, we now sort it at load time.

13-Nov-1992 DavidGra
    inc\sapi.h  Change type alignment to 48k.

05-Nov-1992 DavidGra
    loadomf.c   Forgot to include the types table in the fix for demand
                load of symbols from a .dbg file.

03-Nov-1992 DavidGra
    loadomf.c   Added a new field to the exg structure, lszDebug which
    ph.c        is the full path name to the file that contains the
    sh.c        dedbug info and is used during demand loading of symbols.
    sl.c
    sapi.h

03-Nov-1992 MarkBro
    loadomf.c:
        Changed return she values for various signatures.
            < NB08 == relink
            NB08 == repack
            NB09 == OK
            > NB09 == future symbols.

    ph.c:
        Correction to fix for 4539.  Conditions for checking selector
        limits would always fail.  Corrected if() to check boundary
        condition.

02-Nov-1992 GlennN
    loadomf.c
        fix problem for 32bit world since we indexed on all
        imods.  in our case -1 was special and subtracting
        1 would cause us to wrap and index off of the mod
        array.  In the 32 bit world this would cause them
        to index off the end of the array and gpf.

    ph.c
        fix bug 4539.  problem was that we can't always get
        the right seg limit for the publics address hash (
        we don't know the real logical segment limit until
        later so we use the largest ref'd in the publics
        table itself.  Well, in cases where we are trying
        to find the nearest symbol we can walk off the end
        of the address hash table because of this.  Now, we
        check to see of the segment coming in is with range
        of the segment sort table before looking it up.

30-Oct-1992 DavidGra
    ph.c
        Initialized some variables for publics searching to avoid
        randomly doing a linear search.
    sh.c
        Fix bug when types table is an exactl multiple of 0x4000 bytes long.

30-Oct-1992 MarkBro
    sh.c:
        Fix problem with SHFAddNewPds for dos and windows.  We were
        returning a bad pds when we failed and we were also calling LLUnlock
        with a NULL handle.

28-Oct-1992 GlennN
    sh.c
        Fix bug 4666. We were loading debug information
        twice since ProgLoad in codeview system.c would
        call SYLoadDebugInfo().  Compounding the problem
        was the fact that Run.Load used to attach the debug
        info on a per process basis.  Now we have one and
        only one hpds and all debug information tables are
        associated to this and therefore exhaustive
        searches don't always need the context operator
        like they used to.

28-Oct-1992 MikeMo
    loadomf.c:
        We no longer assume IMAGE_FILE_HEADER.SizeOfOptionalHeader ==
        sizeof(IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER).

27-Oct-1992 MikeMo
    loadomf.c:
        Fix OLLoadOmf so that, when reading directory entries past
        the list of module entries, we don't try to index into
        rghmod [ iMod - 1 ] if iMod == 0xFFFF.

26-Oct-1992 MarkBro
    shinit.c inc\cvtypes.h:
        Change to AVS structure to have alphabetic version

19-Oct-1992 v-natjm
    sh.c:
        Made changes to FHOpen to share the static with the SHUnloadDll
        function. The current  file handle  was locked until CVW.EXE is
        unloaded. We now close  this handle in  SHUnloadDll if the file
        name is matching.

17-Oct-1992 MikeMo
    cvexefmt.h
        Deleted, moved to the CVINC.420 project.

    *.bld
        Changed to reflect new location of CVEXEFMT.H.

16-Oct-1992 MarkBro
    shw0.bld shd1.bld sho1.bld:
        Changed nmake from using a tmp file (which it doesn't delete)
        to a constant $(OBJDIR)\compiler.flg

16-Oct-1992 MikeMo
    cvinfo.h
    cvtypes.h
    shapi.h
    types.h
        Deleted, moved to the CVINC.420 project.

    makefile
    *.bld
        Modified to support the new CVINC.420 project.

11-Oct-1992 MikeMo
    makefile:
        Created CDEBUGNT macro which is distinct from CDEBUG in that
        it uses -Z7 instead of -Zi, and it does not use -f.

10-Oct-1992 MikeMo
    makefile shnt1.bld:
        Fixes for NT build.
    types.h:
        SEGBASED(x) maps to _based(x) for 16-bit, nothing for 32-bit
        INLINE      maps to __inline (the EE uses this)
        _fstrcmp    maps to strcmp on NT
    loadomf.c:
        Fixed very minor bug in CheckSignature, where it wouldn't return
        the right result if the read failed.
    sl.c:
        Minor fix for NT
    shinit.c:
        Remove shdllinit (we now set _CRT_INIT as DLL entry point in NT)
    shapi.h:
        Revise prototypes for use with NT.

09-Oct-1992 JimSa
    ph.c
        Fixes for ambiguous functions and determining when we are done.
        Previously we would recurse indefinitely because we didn't pay
        attention to the incoming hsym, and we assumed we could just
        get the next symbol in the hash. We needed to keep fetching from
        the hash until we got to the current symbol.  Then we know we
        can just get one more.

08-Oct-1992
    sh.c: initialize static to 0 in FHOpen.  Don't ask me
    why this was required but it fixed the problem with
    multiple runs of CV in the same Windows DOS VM.

6-Oct-1992 v-natjm
    sh.c : Compiler was complaining about (lp & 1) in debug build

5-Oct-1992 v-natjm
    makefile: Updated these two files for the new Visual C++ DLL names
    shw0.bld:

4-Oct-1992 MikeMo
    loadomf.c:
        32-bit fixes: changed "far" to "FAR", and changed "int" to "WORD"
        when reading OMF info off the disk.

1-Oct-1992 MarkBro
    makefile:
        Changed DOS sapi to use -G2 for compiles.

29-Sept-1992 v-natjm

        process LF_VARSTRING in S_CONSTANT

28-Aug-1992 JimSa
    sh.c
        Fix for loading Dll's without symbols.  We weren't registering an
        emi.
    loadomf.c
        Fixes for PE loading with multiple debug directory entries.

14-Aug-1992 DavidGra
    sh.c    Correct checking of fLin32 bit.

10-Aug-1992 Davidgra
    sh.c    Don't throw away exe nodes which don't contain symbols.

03-Aug-1992 MarkBro
    sh.c:
        Bad use of ADDRSEG16.  ADDRSEG16 ASSIGNS the addr packet to be
        16 bits not check to see if it is a 16 bit addr.  Changed check
        to do fAddr32 instead.

03-Aug-1992 RossG
    shsymbol.c\shsymlb1.c
        Add support for S_COBOLUDT symbol type.  This is a UDT that cannot
         be symbol packed.
     inc\cvinfo.h
         Update to master copy

30-Jul-1992 Davidgra
    inc\shapi.h
            Add sopRegister for enregistered variable support by
            the disassmbler.

27-Jul-1992 Davidgra/MarkBro
    sh.c
            Fix 32-bit bp-relative symbol lookup from disasm.

            Fix another bug with SHGetSymLoc for negative offsets.

27-Jul-1992 MarkBro
    sl.c:
            Removed some dead code from SLLineToAddr.

21-Jul-1992 MarkBro
    shsymbol.c:
            Fix for Caviar 2411.  "bp 0:0;bl" causes GPF in SHSetCxtMod.
            We were using the segment (unfixed addr) as an index into
            the segmap table.  Problem is that index = seg-1.  0-1 = 0xffff
            which gpf's its brains out.  To fix, if the seg is zero, then
            return NULL for the mod.

20-Jul-1992 JimSa/MarkBro
    loadomf.c
            Fix problem with module contributor with a seg index of 0.

20-Jul-1992 Davidgra/MarkBro
    shsymbol.c
            Changes SHGetSymLoc to return a flat address for 32-bit
            static symbols and to return a 32-bit BP relative offset
            only when the offset will not fit in a 16-bit number.

01-Jul-1992 MarkBro
    shsymbol.c:
            Fixed problem in CheckHandles() in hblk test.  was checking
            pcxt->hProc instead of pcxt->hBlk.

    inc\cvtypes.h:
            Updated DBG_API_VERSION

    sh.c            Corrected caching in SHHexeFromHmod.  It didn't check
                    the hpdsCurr when determining if the cache hexe is the
                    correct one to return.  It's possible for Windows
                    multiple instances to hit the same hmod when in different
                    hpds's.  This would yield different hexes.

04-Jun-1992 MarkBro
    loadomf.c       Added tons of error checking for OOM failures.

19-May-1992 Jonki
    sh.c            when SHLoadDll was invoked twice for the same dll, and
                    it failed to load the omf, it would leave an hexe lying around
                    which would cause the second invocation to return true.
                    Now we remove the hexe that was created by SHLoadDll if the
                    load failed to load the OMF

08-Apr-1992 Davidgra
    loadomf.c       Added code to get debug info location from PE header

02-Apr-1992 DavidGra
    loadomf.c       Added code to detect PE exes for win32s and
    shsymblol.c     to mark addresses as 32-bit based on type

    ph.c        Make find nearest public find only publics less than
                or equal to the address requested.

28-Oct-1991 GlennN
    sl.c        Make sure that in SLNameFromHmod that we check the
                lpsm before the derefence.

24-Oct-1991 MikeMo
    sl.c        Changed SLHmodFromHsf so it doesn't fail when a non-NULL
                HEXE is passed in.

24-Oct-1991 MikeMo
    sl.c        The line number passed to SLFLineToAddr is now a WORD
                rather than an SHOFF.

17-Oct-1991 Jonki
    shsymbol.c  Fix SHSetCxtMod to set the address even if no mod
                was found

16-Oct-1991 JimSa
    shsymbol.c  SHFindNameInContext was passing of lpsstr to pfnCmp rather than
                lpsstr->lpName.

15-Oct-1991 Jonki
    shsymbol.c inc\shapi.h inc\shiproto.h
            Fix SHGetSymLoc to display the location of global stuff correctly.
            This required that we pass it a context, so that we could get the
            emi and fixup the address

12-Oct-1991 GlennN
    sl.c    fix problems with SLHmodFromHsf.  We would sometimes
            return the wrong Hmod due to duplicate files ( includes ) in
            different modules.


10-Oct-1991 RossG
    loadomf.c ph.c shsymbol.c
        Changed the interface to the EE to allow specification of whether
        or not the local symbols of a function are searched while in the
        prolog\epilog of a function.  Also, formalized the hidden convention
        to the interface to the symbol handler.  The parameter that is passed
        as the hvoid parameter passed back to the symbol compare routine is
        now a structure that contains the pointer to the name, length, flags,
        etc. that the symbol handler can use for global and public symbol
        hashing.  Also, there is provision for limiting the symbol searching
        to specific types of symbols (not implemented).

07-Oct-1991 GlennN
    sl.c        fix problem with cb calculation for line count bytes. In
                the case of the last line I was off by one.

07-Oct-1991 GlennN
    sl.c        initialize cb inside of SLLineToAddr so that we don't
                pass in garbage.

02-Oct-1991 DavidGra
    loadomf.c   Removed the start/end fixups to the source lines.  The
                packer should now be taking care of this.

01-Oct-1991 GlennN
    dosdll.asm  fix build for dos due to API name change

27-Sep-1991 GlennN

    makefile    Add OBJDIR as part of parameters passed to shw0.bld
                for shw0.dll build

24-Sep-1991 GlennN

    Bonehead fixes to
    loadomf.c   Fix FixOfpEnd allocation of lpopt table.  We now alloc
                cfiles * cseg * sizeof(opt).  The reason we need this
                is because a file may occur mutiple times for a segment.
                also fix potential problem with return of this function.

                Also, make sure that we free the lpopt table.

    sl.c        Fix problem with GetLpslFromIndex, I was indexing too
                far into the baseSrcLn table.

    32-bit handles and such

04-Sept-1991 MarkBro
        DOS DLLs -- many small changes all over the place.

22-Aug-1991 Jonki
    shsymbol.c  SHSetBlksInCXT MUST compare segments.  Otherwise,
                we screw up when there are multiple logical segments
                in a mod (ex. alloc_text)

19-Aug-1991 Jonki
    loadomf.c    fix to support C++ member functions.  Member functions
        can cause code to come from different contribution locations
        within the segment.  We need to calulate the end offset based
        on the last mds with a matching index.

13-Aug-1991 Jonki
    shsymbol.c  hacked SHSetBlksInCXT until the packer is fixed.

12-Ayg-1991 Jonki
    shsymbol.c  Corrected SHAddrFromHsym - make sure that fAddrLI is set
                after we have built the addr to be returned

12-Aug-1991 Jonki
    ph.c    Correct error in computation of pPubEnd in PHFindNameInPublics

07-Aug-1991 Davidgra
    \sapi\ph.c      Check to see that there is a valid publics or
    \sapi\shsymbol.c globals table before attempting to search it.
                     this used to fall out with a cpubs or cglobs
                     of 0, now we check explicitly for the
                     appropriate lpssmr of NULL.

06-Aug-1991 Davidgra
    \sapi\loadomf.c Rework the publics hashing code.  The hash table
    \sapi\ph.c      now appears on disk with length prefixed chain
    \sapi\shtypes.h tables.  The chain tables are loaded in sections
                    if the total size of the tables is greater that
                    cbMaxAlloc.

05-Aug-1991 Jonki
    loadomf.c sh.c th.c cvproto.h cvtypes.h shproto.h shtypes.h
        Allow for up to 64K distinct types, by making rgitd a huge array.
        Also defined _HUGE.  Also removed some old ems junk from OLLoadTypes

01-Aug-1991 GlennN

    \sapi\loadomf.c disabled the loading of hash table to get past of
                    gpf loading excel.


26-Jul-1991 Davidgra
    \sapi\shsymbol.c Fix bug in SHSetCXTMod with caching.  We were not
    checking to see if the current process was the same as the process
    when we created the cache.

26-Jul-1991 MarkBro
    \sapi\shsymbol.c Fix bug in SHSetCXTMod with caching.  We were not
    checking to see if the emi of the addr matched the cached hexs.  Now
    we are.

08-Jul-1991 Davidgra
    \sapi\shsymbol.c Calculate end of symbol table correctly ( size includes
                    the leading long ) for SHSetBlksInCXT

03-Jul-1991 MikeMo
    \sapi\loadomf.c Improved return values from CheckSignature so the user
                    gets a better error message depending on NBxx format.

01-Jul-1991 GlennN
    added hack for code in include files for RossG.
    bug fix for callstack navigation.
    bug fix 1062 for MarkBro a at csip other than that at main.


    \sapi\LoadOmf.c hack is marked as M00KLUDGE.  The change was to first
                    save the first file with line number information that
                    has .c .cxx .bas .for .asm extension as the main module
                    stored in the hmds structure in OLLoadSrc.
    \sapi\shsymlb1.c
                    bug was that we weren't checking offset for files in
                    SHLineFromAddr().  So we put in a check for offset
                    verification.

    \sapi\inc\shtypes.h
                    Added defines for STRUPR and STRSTR into sapi for calls
                    to the runtime.  This was for hack made to loadomf.c
