Mac-specific changes to rcpp
============================

/mac
	Preprocess resource script for Macintosh compatibility
	Causes rcpp to translate \n as 0x0D and \r as 0x0A, which are the Macintosh
	conventions.

The preprocessor flag _MAC is automatically defined by rc when it is executing
rcpp on a Macintosh-targetted resource script.


Mac-specific changes to rc
==========================

/m
	Generate Macintosh-compatible resources
	Causes rc to generate a binary image of a Macintosh resource fork instead of
	a Win32 resource file. Some resources are converted into their corresponding
	Macintosh resource formats instead of being written using their Win32 formats:

		group icons		=>	ICN#, icl4/8, ics4/8, icm4/8
		group cursors	=>	CURS
		string tables	=>	STR#

	Other standard resources are given the following Macintosh resource types:

		bitmap			=>	WBMP
		menu			=>	WMNU
		dialog			=>	WDLG
		accelerator		=>	WACC
		rcdata			=>	HEXA

/brNNNN
/br:NNNN
/br NNNN
	Set base resource ID for named resources
	The Windows resource format supports resources that have a name but not an
	ID. Macintosh resources always have an ID and may optionally have a name.
	rc therefore picks an arbitrary ID when it encounters a resource that has
	a name but not an ID. By default, the first resource ID used is 128, and
	subsequent resources get successively greater resource IDs. /br is used
	to change the base resource ID. This may be useful if you're building a 
	resource file that will be released as part of a library, and you wish to
	have your resources numbered in an unused part of the 128..32K space.
	The value is assumed to be decimal and must be from 1 to 32767.


New errors:
RC1209: invalid option; missing resource base number after /br
	The /br option requires an integer argument to follow it.
RC1210: resource base number must be from 1 to 32767
	The base resource number given to the /br option must fit into a
	positive 16-bit integer.

New warnings:
RC4506: scaling cursor %3 down to 16 by 16
	RC only supports creating Macintosh cursors that are 16x16 and monochrome.
	A Windows cursor whose dimensions are a multiple of 16x16 will be scaled
	down to 16x16, losing data in the process.
RC4507: Macintosh cursor %3 must be 16 by 16 and monochrome; ignored
	No Windows cursor was found whose dimensions were a multiple of 16x16 and
	that was monochrome.
RC4508: Ignoring icon %3 with invalid Macintosh size or color
	RC supports creating mini, small, and standard Macintosh icons. These icons
	have dimensions of 16x12, 16x16, and 32x32, respectively, and may have bit
	depths of 1, 4, or 8 bits. This warning is generated if no icon matching
	these requirements was found in an icon file.
RC4509: Resource types '%3' and '%4' were both mapped to '%5'
	A Windows resource type other than one of the standard types will be converted
	into a Macintosh resource type by using the first four characters of the
	Windows type name. This warning is generated if different Windows resource
	types are identical in their first four characters, causing them to be mapped
	to the same Macintosh resource type.


The default extension for the output file is .rsc instead of .res when building
a Mac resource file, to match the default extension used by mrc.

The lexical analyzer converts \n to 0x0D and \r to 0x0A, which are the
Macintosh conventions.

The default styles for all button controls do not include WS_TABSTOP, unlike Win32.

If the input codepage is Windows Latin 1, Greek, Cyrillic, Turkish, or Eastern
European, the output text is translated into the corresponding Mac codepage before
being written to the destination resource file. The translation performed by Win32
is *not* the same as the translation that was performed by the WLM 1.0 rc.exe; Win32
translates some characters differently and replaces characters that have no
matches with question marks instead the non-breaking space that was used by the
WLM 1.0 rc.exe.
