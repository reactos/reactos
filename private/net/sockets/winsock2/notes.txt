WSPStartup(): should pass upcall table by reference, not by value.

WSPGetProcTable(): lpProcTable should be "LPVOID FAR *" since it is used to
    query multiple tables, not just the SPI table.

WSPSelect(): should not pass nfds parameter, as this is ALWAYS ignored.

Forcing SPI entrypoints to honor errors like WSAEINPROGRESS and
    WSANOTINITIALISED means all service providers must maintain their own
    per-thread state.

For non-overlapped sockets, should they be _IO_ALERT or _IO_NONALERT?

Use Reserved field of APC for flags sent to completion routine!
