In ICM, the following two stuff will be migrated to NT 5 from Win9x.

+ Color Management Module (CMM).
   - System default CMM:
         Win95 uses Kodak CMM, but Win98 use Lino's one. The case for Win95
         to Win98 update, Win98 just overwrite kodak CMM with Lino's one,
         so they does not consider to keep Kodak as default.
         So, here same thing as NT5. NT5 just use Lino's one and does not
         consider Kodak at all (at migrate from Win95).
   - Application installed CMM:
         If the CMM is able to fit NT5 (which mean they have enough exports
         from DLL), we will migrate it, but if apps does not register it to
         right registry path, we will not. So in this case only migrate from
         Win98 need to be considerred, since there is no installable CMM
         supported in Win95.  

+ Color Profile.
   - Device Profile:
         This is depend on driver, so shouldn't be migrate from Win9x.
         it mean the color profile which used in Win9x will not be associated
         to corresponding device automatically. but otherhand, if NT driver
         specified color profile in INF, we will associate it automatically 
         (same as regular driver installation). But still all the device profile
         which installed on Win98 will keeps "installed" state after migration.
   - Other profiles:
         If apps (not driver !) installed thier own color profile to system,
         should be migrate to NT. so these profile keeps "installed" state
         after migrate from Win9x.
