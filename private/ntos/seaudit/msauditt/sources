# The following entry information is a bit of a hack.  The code isn't
# needed, but our linker doesn't know how to build a dll with data only.
# When MikeOl gets this fixed, we can remove the code and this obligatory
# entry and base information.  By the way, the base choice is just one I
# know isn't used elsewhere in the system.
