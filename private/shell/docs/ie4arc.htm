<h1 align="center">IE 4.0: Shell &amp; Browser Architecture</h1>

<h2 align="center"><em>Exective Summary: Evolution from IE 3.0</em></h2>

<p><font color="#408080" size="2"><em>Note 1: In this document,
the word </em>&quot;browser&quot;<em> means the code which
provides the browser frame-UI (menu, title and toolbars) and the
navigational behavior. The clear separation of the browser-frame
and viewers (e.g., HTML viewer, shell folder viewers, etc.) is
one of our major technical advantages over our competitors.</em></font></p>

<p><font color="#408080" size="2"><em>Note 2: Most of features
described in this documents are pure shell/browser features, but
some of them are cross-components features which involves changes
in URLMON, WININET and MSHTML.</em></font><font size="2"><em> </em></font></p>

<p>This document describes the changes in the IE 4.0 shell
achitecture from IE 3.0 and Win95 shell. Please notice that it's
not the list of features, but the list of components or
architectual changes with which we implement various features.
The corresponding features are highlighted by underlines. </p>

<ol>
    <li>New HTML Viewer<font color="#408080"><em> -- Beta1</em></font><p>IE
        1.0 and 2.0 was a monolithic EXE which was not
        componentized at all and hard to maintain. During the
        development of IE 3.0, we packaged HTML viewer code from
        IE 2.0 into a COM object -- an HTML Viewer, and wrote a
        mini-explorer on top of it, which is capable hosting any
        shell view windows (file system folder views and etc.)
        and any DocObjects (such as Excel, Word or Visio) as well
        as HTML viewers. IE 4.0 replaced the HTML viewer with
        much more advanced viewer which supports &quot; the
        dynamic HTML. <u>It allows the web authors to create much
        richer and interactive pages</u>. <font color="#408080">Contact:
        GaryBu, SatoNa</font></p>
    </li>
    <li>Shell Integration<font color="#408080"><em> -- Beta1</em></font><p>IE
        3.0 was a mini shell-explorer which is capable hosting
        any shell view windows, and we added the internet (http,
        ftp and etc.) as a separate name space extension. Under
        IE 4.0, we are fully integrating these two by (1) making
        the internet as a part of the shell namespace, and (2)
        merging the IE 3.0 browser and the Windows 95 shell
        explorer into a single browser frame code. <u>It allows
        the end-user to navigate local and remove file system and
        the internet from the same Explorer window</u>.We also
        make it highly componentized so that we can configure the
        explorer window as needed (such as folder vs. explorer,
        or integrated-shell vs. browser-only). <font

    </li>
    <li>Layout Negotiation (Toolbar and Toolband)<font
        color="#408080"><em> -- some in Beta1, will be completed
        in Beta2</em></font><p>IE 3.0 introduced limited layout
        negotiation mechanism to support OLE-style toolbar space
        negotiation and its own toolbar. IE 4.0 extended that
        mechanism and it has three types of layout negotiations,
        (1) OLE-style negotiation for ActiveX Document, such as
        Excel and Visio, (2) toolbar space negotiation for
        internal and external components, such as its own toolbar
        and explorer pane, (3) toolband space negotiation within
        a toolbar for internal and external bands, such as
        address band, search band and quick launch band. The
        desktop window also support (2) and (3) and that's how we
        made the tray and deskband extensible. <u>These mechanism
        allows the users to customizes their browser and desktop
        more flexibly and gives opportunities to ISVs and ICPs to
        add values to the user's environment.</u> <font
        color="#408080">Contact: CheeChew, AndyP, SatoNa</font></p>
    </li>
    <li>Browser Object Model<font color="#408080"><em> -- Beta1</em></font><p>Under
        IE 3.0, the <em>window, location, navigator and history </em>objects
        were implemented as a part of the currently viewed HTML
        document. That implemenation was causing many Navigator
        compatibility problems (such as window.open(&quot;&quot;)
        and document.write). To fix this problem, we've moved the
        majority of those implementation to the browser side of
        code. This new architecture is much more compatible with
        the implied object mode. It also allows us to make the <em>document</em>
        object of a newly created browser window available much
        more earlier. <u>This change alone is contributing to
        over 10% of jump in our compatibility measurement</u>. <font
        color="#408080">Contact: ChrisFra, SatoNa</font></p>
    </li>
    <li>HTTP-EQUIV tags and HTTP headers<font color="#408080"><em>
        -- some in Beta1, will be completed in Beta2</em></font><p>Under
        IE3.0, HTTP-EQUIV tags are handled by the code HTML
        viewer, which is written specifically for HTTP-EQUIV. It
        is causing some bugs and inconsistencies -- for example,
        IE 3.0 does not support the client-pull passed via the
        real HTTP headers. IE 4.0, all HTTP-EQUIV tags are simply
        passed up to the containing browser and handled by the
        same code that handles real HTTP headers. <u>This change
        has fixed several problems in client-pull, PICS rating
        and expiration date and removed the inconsistencies
        between HTTP-EQUIV tags and real HTTP headers</u>. <font
        color="#408080">Contact: TonyCi, SatoNa</font></p>
    </li>
    <li>View-State<font color="#408080"><em> -- Beta2</em></font><p>IE
        3.0 relied on the object-cache to maintain the view state
        (such as texts in a form or the scroll position) of last
        couple of pages. This mechanism was limitted in the
        number of pages it remembers the view state (up to 4
        pages) and was not working well with certain pages (such
        as those that immediately expires). IE 4.0's browser
        solves this problem by providing a view state storage for
        each pages in the navigation stack. <u>It remembers the
        view state of up to 100 pages</u>. <font color="#408080">Contact:
        TonyCi, SatoNa</font></p>
    </li>
    <li>Asynchronous Navigation and Activation Blocking<font
        color="#408080"><em> -- Beta1</em></font><p>To <u>improve
        the scripting compatibility</u>, we've changed how we
        handle the navigation request from the script. When we
        receive it, we start the navigation asynchronously but
        deffer the activation of the new page until the first
        page finishes running the script. We've also added <u>the
        asynchronous PICS rating query</u>. We sends a request to
        the PICS server asynchronously (at the same time we sends
        the HTTP request for the page itself). In case we
        receives the responce from the HTTP server before the
        PICS server, we deffer the activation of the new page
        until the PICS server responces. <font color="#408080">Contact:
        ChisFra, GregJ, SatoNa</font></p>
    </li>
    <li>Background Page Formatting for better perceived
        performance<font color="#408080"><em> -- Beta1</em></font><p>To
        improved the perceived performance, we start formatting
        HTML pages before we display it. IE 3.0 emulated this
        behavior by synchronously activating the new page but
        leaving the bits of the previous page on the screen for a
        certain amount of time. This mechanism, however, does not
        work all the time (does not work with frame-set pages)
        and makes the browser inaccessible during that delay.
        We've solved this problem by not showing (UIActivating)
        the new page (leaving the previous page fully accessible)
        until the format of the first page is done (the
        Ready-State property becomes &quot;interactive&quot;). <u>The
        user will see less re-painting and re-layouting when
        browsing the web and feels faster</u>. <font
        color="#408080">Contact: MikeSh, SatoNa</font></p>
    </li>
    <li>Keyboard Navigation and Dispatching<font color="#408080"><em>
        -- Beta1</em></font><p>Keyboard Navigation of IE 3.0 was
        implemented very specifically for the scenario we had and
        was not extensible. In order to dispatch and translate
        input messages appropriately among multiple frame
        components (toolbars, toolbands, the frame and the main
        document/shellview), we introduced a generic mechanism to
        keep track of the focus and let them translate messages
        correctly. We've also changed how the input messages are
        translated to make it much more in-synced with OC96 spec
        (window-less control spec). <u>These changes allow the
        user to tabbing between the main page, toolbars and bands
        (such as the addressbar, search band)</u>. <font
        color="#408080">Contact: AndyP, SatoNa</font></p>
    </li>
    <li>Inter-page Transition<font color="#408080"><em> -- some
        in Beta1, will be completed in Beta2</em></font><p>IE 4.0
        supports the inter-page transitoin, which allows external
        components (ActiveX transition controls) to play page
        transition animations (such as fade-out/fade-in or
        page-flipping) when the user navigates from one page to
        another. <u>It allows the page authors to specify the
        transitions to be played when the page is being opened</u>
        via either HTTP header or HTTP-EQUIV tag.<u> It will make
        the web-browsing much more like TV experience</u>. <font
        color="#408080">Contact: MWinser, SatoNa</font></p>
    </li>
    <li>User Feedback<font color="#408080"><em> -- some in Beta1,
        will be completed in Beta2</em></font><p>Lack of (or not
        enough) user feedback ma cause some frustration to the
        end-user, especially under slow or asynchonous
        environment like browsing over a modem. IE 4.0 improves
        the usability of the browser by (1) introducing sound
        scheme such as &quot;start navigation&quot; and
        &quot;complete navigation&quot;, (2) showing the <em>total</em>
        progress in the progress bar and (3) making the animating
        logo state more accurate. <font color="#408080">Contact:

    </li>
    <li>File Download<p><font color="#000000">When we start
        downloading files with types which we can't browse
        in-plate, we start the file-download UI. To make it fully
        modeless (so that the user can continue using the browser
        window), we start a separate thread for this
        file-download UI. Under IE3.0, it causes double-download
        (sending the same HTTP request to the server twice)
        because there was no way to pass the download transaction
        from on thread to another. Under IE 4.0, we've solved
        this problem by adding the transactoin marshalling
        capability to URLMON. <u>This makes it more reliable to
        download files from busy servers</u>. </font><font

    </li>
    <li>Mail/News Integration<p><font color="#000000">IE 3.0 's
        Mail/News integration is limitted -- the list of those
        external components (under the Go menu) is limitted and
        the only thing the user can do is opening Mail and News
        window. IE4.0 extended it by making fully registry based.
        <u>It allows other clients (such as the address book and
        the calender) to add their meuitems to the browser. It
        also allows those clients to provide items under the
        File-&gt;New menu, such as &quot;create a new mail
        message&quot; or &quot;add a new appointment&quot;</u>.</font><font

    <li>Pluggable Protocol Support<font color="#408080"><em> --
        some in Beta1, will be completed in Beta2</em></font><p><font
        color="#000000">The pluggable protocol support of IE 3.0
        was very limitted and not extensible enough to really add
        new protocols. IE 4.0 made it possible. IE 4.0 itself add
        various new protocols (such as &quot;javascript:&quot;,
        &quot;about:&quot; and &quot;help:&quot;) to fully
        utilize thie new feature. Each protocol provider provides
        a COM object which can transfer byte streams and a set of
        registry settings which specifies various properties of
        the protocol (such as opaqueness and default PICS
        rating). </font><font color="#408080">Contact: ChrisFra,

    <li>Internet Shortcut<font color="#408080"><em> -- some in
        Beta2 (punt others to IE 5.0)</em></font><p><font
        color="#000000">Windows 95 introduced the shell shortcut
        (.LNK files) and IE 2.0 and 3.0 introduced the internet
        shortcut (.URL files). When we integrate the shell
        explorer and the browser under IE 4.0, we also merged
        features of shell shotcut into the internet shotcut, so
        that it became THE shortcut which can points any objects
        in the shell name space. <u>We are also adding the
        scripting capability to it so that it becomes the shell
        script file format</u>. The channel bar will use this
        scripting capability to <u>open browsers in theater mode</u>.

        of a toolband which shows the contents of any shell
        folders (a folder in the shell name space). <u>It allows
        the end-users to cofigue their browsers and desktops with
        various links -- the quick lancher and the quick links
