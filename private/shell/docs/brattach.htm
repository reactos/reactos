<h2>IE 4.0 : Browser Helper Extension</h2>

<p>This document describes one of new features of IE 4.0, which
is called &quot;browser helper&quot;, which allows programmers to
&quot;attach&quot; a COM object to each browser window to monitor
user's action or add some capability to the browser window. </p>

<p>When a browser window (only top-level one, not an WebBrowser
OC) is created, it looks up the registry enumerate all keys under
the following registry key:</p>

<p>HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\BrowserHelperObject</p>

<p>Each key must be a valid CLSID for an In-Proc server. For each
CLSID, the browser creates an instance of that class (by calling
CoCreateInstance), QueryInterface to IID_IObjectWithSite (must be
supported) and call its SetSite member with the IUnknown pointer
to the automation interface of the browser window itself. Each
attachment will be added as a browser property with the CLSID
string as the property ID (using PutProperty member of
IWebBrowserApp). </p>

<p>Such an helper object may register itself as an event sink to
monitor the user's navigation or call automation interfaces to
control the browser window. It's up to the helper object what it
does when it receives such an event. If it requires to display
any UI within the browser frame window, the programmer should
register a UI component as one of <a href="browbar.htm">BrowserBar
extension</a>. </p>

<p>Those helper objects will be released when the browser is
being closed. They must release all the out-going interfaces and
unregister themselves as event sinks when their SetSite member is
called with NULL pointer -- not when their last reference counts
are released (to break any circular reference counts). </p>
