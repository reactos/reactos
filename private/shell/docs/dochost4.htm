<h2>IE 4.0 : ActiveX Document Hosting - Changes from IE 3.0</h2>

<p>This document summarizes the changes we made to IE 4.0's
ActiveX Document Hosting code. We made some changes to the
hosting code to fix some bugs and improve the user's experience.
Although those changes are carefully made so that it won't cause
any compatibility problems (either for IE or existing ActiveX
components on the market/web), we want to share this information
so that programmers can write even better ActiveX components for
IE4 while maintaining IE3 compatibility. </p>

<h4><a name="4-object-cache is eliminated">4-Object-Cache Is
Eliminated</a></h4>

<p>Under IE 3.0, each browser frame has an 4-object-cache, which
keeps references to four most recently accessed ActiveX document
objects. This was a mechanism to (1) keep the OLE server
running/loaded and (2) preserve the view state (such as the
scroll position). We, however, found several problems with this
implementation -- such as a problem with the &quot;onload&quot;
event, a problem with &quot;post&quot; result page and etc. </p>

<p>IE 4.0 no longer caches ActiveX document objects. When the
user navigates away from that page, we immediately release the
last reference count to that object. To keep the OLE server
runnning/loaded for a while, we call IClassFactory::LockServer
(see <a href="#Notes">notes</a> below). To preserve the view
state, we introduced a new mechanism to persist view states for
each pages (this mechanism works only with HTML pages -- the
future version of IE may support for other types of documents). </p>

<p>Please note that this change may affect the behavior of
ActiveX controls in HTML pages as well. Under IE 3.0, controls on
an HTML page were kept in memory while the parent page is in the
4-object-cache. Under IE 4.0, those objects are destroyed and
re-created. </p>

<p><a name="Notes">Notes</a>: Although OLE's spec says calling
IClassFactory::LockServer(TRUE) is sufficient to keep the OLE
server running/loaded, we found many existing OLE servers are not
implementing it correctly. Many out-of-process servers shutdown
their server processes when we release the last reference count
to their instances. To work around this problem, we put two
special code in IE 4.0.</p>

<p>(1) In addition to calling IClassFactory::LockServer(TRUE), we
also call IClassFactory::CreateInstance and keeps the reference
count to that object too. It solves this problem for most of OLE
servers.</p>

<p>(2) In addition to above, if the class has a <a
href="browserf.htm">browser flag</a>, BROWSERFLAG_INITNEWTOKEEP
(a new flag in IE 4.0), we create an empty IStorage and calls
IPersistStorage::InitNew of the instance. </p>
