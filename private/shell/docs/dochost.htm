<h2>Features and Known bugs</h2>

<p>Because ActiveX Document (DocObject) mechanism is new to us
and it is sometimes difficult to tell what we can expect and what
should be reported as a bug. Therefore, I wrote this document to
summarize list of features that are supposed to work, may work or
are expected not to work, including known bugs. I also describe
some of work-around we put in the container code (IE/shell frame)
to work around some bugs in ActiveX Document objects. </p>

        <a href="#PowerPoint">Visio</a></li>
    <li><a href="#news">What's New (or latest check-in's)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>By the way, please remember that application programs may
intentionally behave differently when it's opened as a DocObject.
If you notice a certain feature is disabled under IE, please
double check if it is disabled under the Office binder as well.
If it is disabled, it's most likely a by-design. </p>

<h2><a name="features">ActiveX Document Features</a></h2>

<h3>A. Features that are supposed to work</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Navigate-in-place a document over HTTP protocol</li>
    <li>Navigate-in-place a document over FILE protocol</li>
    <li>File-&gt;Save is always disabled over HTTP protocol</li>
    <li>File-&gt;Save is enabled (and works) after modified over
        FILE protocol</li>
    <li>File-&gt;SaveAs is always enabled regardress the protocol
        (Default name is not fancy -- #23452 shdocvw)</li>
    <li>Refresh button re-loads the document (does not work
        except for HTML -- #20995 shdocvw)</li>
    <li>Negotiate the toolbar space correctly (opening,
        drag&amp;drop, activating an embedding, etc.)</li>
    <li>Closing the browser window will shutdown the app
        correctly.</li>
    <li>Navigate-in-place in a sub-frame works and shouldn't
        merge menu or add toolbars.</li>
    <li>Help pulldown is either merged or replaced and works.</li>
    <li>When navigating away from the modified document, a
        &quot;may save&quot; message box will pop up (IE does,
        but Explorer doesn't -- #5067 explorer).</li>
    <li>If the user says No to the &quot;may save&quot; message
        box and navigate back, the document should be re-loaded.</li>
    <li>Dragging a DocObject document (from the shell) onto the
        title bar of a browser window (which is looking at
        another DocObject including a HTML document) will open
        that document in-place. </li>
    <li>Typically a LocalServer DocObject application creates its
        own top-level stand-alone window. It is supposed to keep
        it invisible (or inactivated if it's already visible)
        while we are navigating in-place. </li>
    <li>Keyboard input (including accelerators) will be handled
        by the appropriate component. </li>
</ol>

<h3>B. Features that will work only if the DocObject support it</h3>

<ol>
    <li>File-&gt;Print and Print button in the Internet Toolbar
        is enabled and works.</li>
    <li>File-&gt;Page Setup is enabled and works.</li>
    <li>File-&gt;Properties is enabled and works</li>
    <li>Print/Pring-Preview buttons on app's toolbar (donot work
        right now -- #19852 shdocvw)</li>
    <li>Save button on app's toolbar</li>
    <li>Non-conflicting accelerator should work Conflicting
        accelerator will be handled by the DocObject.</li>
    <li>Help menu will be merged (both IE help menu items and
        DocObject help menu items will be available under a
        single Help menu) only if the DocObject supports the help
        menu merging. Word supports it, but Excel doesn't. If
        DocObject does not support it, only DocObject help menu
        items will be available. </li>
</ol>

<h3>C. Features that are not supposed to work</h3>

<ol>
    <li>New/Open button on app's toolbar -- they are supposed to
        be disabled.</li>
    <li>App specific status bar components -- the status bar is
        owned by the frame.</li>
    <li>Edit-&gt;Copy/Paste/Cut applies to text on the Internet
        Toolbar -- just like Word95.</li>
    <li>DocObject in sub-frame being UIActivated (merging
        menu/toolbar) -- the top-level HTML DocObject is supposed
        to be UIActivated no matter which sub-frame has the
        focus. </li>
    <li>Many other features DocObjects intentionally disable
        (which we can reproduce under Office Binder)</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="bugs">Known app-specific bugs (build 1089)</a></h2>

<h3><a name="Word95">Word95</a></h3>

<p>A-1&amp;2 (was able to work-around): Word95 (and 97 as well)
has an internal state which indicates whether or not that's an
embedding or not. Just loading a document (via
IPersistFile::Load) and activating in-place won't work because of
this internal state. In order to make it work we need to call its
IOleObject::SetHostName. To avoid side-effect with other apps, we
do it only for Word95 and Word97. </p>

<p>A-1&amp;2: A few people reported a problem in in-place
navigation (opens up in a separate window instead), but
reinstalling Office solved that problem in all cases. In one of
these cases, we found that docobj.dll was not registered
correctly as a marshaller of IOleDocument interface -- the cause
is unknown.</p>

<p>A-7 (won't fix): When switching the view mode (among Normal,
Outline, Page Layout, ...), Word puts its toolbar behind the
internet toolbar. It relocated those toolbars correctly if I
resize the frame window. As far as I can tell, it seems that Word
is assuming that the border rectangle (which we return from
IOleInPlaceUIWindow::GetBorder) is the same as the client
rectangle of the hwndFrame in this particular senario. Because
this Word bug is hard to work-around (we need to call its
ResizeBorder when we detecct this senario, but it's very hard to
detect it) and the user can work-around (need to resize the frame
window), we resolve this bug as &quot;won't fix&quot;. -- #23271</p>

<p>A-9 (was able to work-around): We found a bug in Word95, which
does not display anything until we <em>UIActivate</em> it. This
is fine if the document is the top-level DocObject, but not fine
if the document is opened in a sub-frame. To work-around this
bug, we detect this case by calling <em>SetRect</em> right after
SetInPlaceSite. If it fails, we call <em>UIActivate</em> on it
(with a hidden frame window so that added toolbar won't be
shown). </p>

<p>A-13 (probably won't fix): There is a report that
drag&amp;dropping a Word document onto a browser window will
cause many problems occationally (the exact repro senario is not
known). It's most likely a bug in WinWord. Unless we can come up
with a way to work-around this bug, we have no choice other than
shipping IE/Nashville without adressing this bug. -- #20475</p>

<p>A-14 (won't fix): Under a certain condition (typically the
document is already opened by another machine), Word pops up its
own dialog box (such as &quot;Document is already opened by foo.
Do you want to open it read-only?&quot;) while we are activating
it. When this happens, Word incorrectly make its own MDI frame
visible and bring it to the front.</p>

<p>Other (to be investigated): Under Nashvile opening a Word's
dialog (such as View-&gt;Toolbar) multiple times while the
dropdown box on the shell toolbar has the focus will eventually
cause GPF in Word. It sounds like a bug in Word. -- #6530</p>

<p>Other (by design): The Wizard button if Table-&gt;Insert
dialog box is disabled. This button is disabled when you open a
Word document in a binder file. -- #24095</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="Excel95">Excel95</a></h3>

<p>A-1 (probably by-design): When opening an Excel document over
HTTP for the second time (when it's cached), Excel complains that
the document is being modified and can be opened only as
read-only. This is caused by the fact that WININET keeps the
cached file left open when it's already cached. Although there is
a bug in WININET (WININET must be consistent -- #29828), it is
almost by-design that Excel pops up this dialog box for a cached
file because a http protocol is virtually a read-only protocol
(don't argue about POST). </p>

<p>A-1/2 (Excecl bug - won't fix): Excel95 fails to perform
IPersistFile::Load while another excel file is UIActive. This is
a known problem and Binder95 has a work around (it calls
pUIActiveObject-&gt;OnFrammeWindowActivate(FALSE) before calling
pmk-&gt;BindToObject). We can't apply this work around in IE
because we need to make it sure that we hit this code path only
if we are navigating from an Excel page to another. Even though
we put this work around (using the CLSID nodified by the URLMON),
it won't cover all the cases, which involves a frame-set. (#4214)</p>

<p>A-8 (looking for a work-around): It's known that Excel does
not shutdown correctly even after we close the browser window. It
seems that the excel object is not closed/released correctly.
Because of this bug, visiting the same page causes a wrong
message box, which says &quot;XXX is being modified by YYY. Open
as read-only?&quot;. We have been trying to work-around this
Excel bug, but not successful at this moment The latest
work-around suggested by Excel team (QI'ing to IDataObject
calling OleCreateFromData) stopped the GPF but leaks a temp file,
which is pretty BAD (#6030 excel)</p>

<p>A-4: A person is experience that File-&gt;Save menu is always
enabled when opening an Excel document over File protocol,
although I can't reproduce it on my machine. It very much looks
like a bug in Excel, which returns S_OK to IsDirty under a
certain condition even though the document has not been modified.
Since this is an Excel bug and the symptom is minor; we will not
do anything on this bug. (#15551 won't fix -- Excel bug). </p>

<p>B-4/5 (won't fix): The Print/PrintPreview/Save buttons on
Excel's toolbar are disabled, which is a bug in Excel. </p>

<p>B-6 (probably won't fix): Ctrl+O does not work. Excel is
unneccessarily eating ctrl+O key even though it does not own the
File menu. -- #25633</p>

<p>B-7 (won't fix): Excel95 does not support help menu merging.
Therefore, only Excel's help menu items are available under the
Help menu. You'll see the same result under the Office binder. </p>

<p>Other (won't fix): Selecting the &quot;Insert...&quot;
menuitem of the context menu of a tab won't allow you to insert a
module. Excel doesn't allow you to add it when it's opened under
the Office Binder either. This is an Excel bug and we won't fix
(#19840 won't fix). Harvard Chart XL Chart causes a Macro error,
&quot;a method of Workbook class failed&quot; -- it also happens
under the Office Binder (#25876 won't fix).</p>

<h3><a name="Excel 97">Excel 97</a></h3>

<p>A-15 (won't fix -- app bug): When the user clicks the address
bar then clicks the client are of Excel, the input focus remains
on the address bar. This is caused by the fact that Excel does
not call SetFocus when it's clicked. From IE's point of view,
there is nothing we can do. The same problem happens under both
Outlook and Binder. We've exchanged <a
href="email/ExcelFocusProblem_4441.msg">a couple of e-mail</a>
and concluded that Excel guys are going to fix this problem. (IE
bug #4441). </p>

<h3><a name="PowerPoint">PowerPoint</a></h3>

<p>A-4 (won't fix): Powerpoint does not save when the user select
the File-&gt;Save (after modifying the document over file
protocol). IPersistFile::Save always returns E_NOIMPLE. It looks
like the Powerpoint does not implement IPersistFile::Save. --
#35211</p>

<p>A-9 (looking for a work-around): Just like Word95, PowerPoint
does not create a window (leave it blank) when it's opened in a
sub-frame, in which case we won't <em>UIActivate</em> it. This is
a PowerPoint bug but we need to come up with a work-around --
#23495</p>

<h3><a name="Visio">Visio</a></h3>

<p>A-1/2 (investigating): We have a report that there is a case
when Visio opens up in a saparate window. I was able to repro
this bug on my own machine a couple of times but not
consistently. The cause is unknown, but probably a Visio bug
(#17878).&nbsp; </p>

<p>A-4 (postponed): After opening a VISIO file over file protocol
and modify it, File-&gt;Save is enabled correctly. It, however,
does nothing when the user select it. We've found out that
passing TRUE as fRemember to IPersistFile::Save will fix this
problem, but we are not making that change for IE 3.0 (#35077 -
#29938 and 35101 are realted)</p>

<h2><a name="news">What's New (latest resolved/understood bugs)</a></h2>

<ul>
    <li>5/30/96 24776-fixed in 1089: Toolbar flashes heavily when
        navigating from one Word document to another.</li>
    <li>5/30/96 24763-fixed in 1089: Explorer popup menus missing
        when hosting a Word document with embedded (24764 is also
        fixed by the same delta).</li>
    <li>5/31/96 23271-won't fix: When you open a word doc in
        IE3.0, and use the page layout button, you loose the
        toolbars. See <a href="#Word95">Word95</a>/A-7 for
        detail.</li>
    <li>6/12/96 25633 - fixed: Ctrl+O and Ctrl+X now works
        correctly while hosting a Word document. The number of
        entries in the accelerator table returned from
        IOleInPlaceSite::GetWindowContext was wrong. </li>
    <li>7/5/96 We call SetHostName only for Word95 and Word97
        (instead of always). We found calling SetHostName causes
        some side effect on other apps (such as Excel and
        MSPaint). See <a href="#Word95">Word95</a>/A-1&amp;2 for
        detail.</li>
    <li>7/8/96 29828 -- by-design. Found out why Excel complains
        that the document is already &quot;being modified&quot;
        when the file is cached. See <a href="#PowerPoint">Excel95</a>/A-1
        for detail. </li>
    <li>9/27/96 IE bug 4441 -- Resolved as won't fix. See <a
        href="#Excel 97">Excel97</a>/A-15 for detail. </li>
