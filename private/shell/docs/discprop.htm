<h2>IE 4.0 : Discarable Browser Property</h2>

<p>This document describes one of new features of IE 4.0, which
is called &quot;discardable browser property&quot;, which allows
ActiveX controls or documents to pass some information across
pages or cache some data. This mechanism will be used in
following cases:</p>

<ul>
    <li>An ActiveX control in an HTML page gathers some data
        (such as a shopping list) from the user and passes it to
        another control in the subsequent pages. </li>
    <li>Two ActiveX controls in two different HTML pages wants to
        coordinate and play a music or an animation continuously
        when the user browse from one page to anotherl. </li>
    <li>An ActiveX control which retrieves some large data
        asynchronously from the server wants to cache it so that
        it does not have to download the same data again when the
        user visits the same or similar page.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>IE 3.0 has a capability to store arbitrary data or objects
(VARIANT) as properties of each browser window. Any programs
which can access IWebBrowserApp interface can call its
PutProperty and GetProperty member to store and retrieve those
properties. This mechanism was not useful for ActiveX controls or
documents because IE 3.0 browser did not have any capability to
&quot;expire&quot; them. Once properties are added, it stays
until the browser window is closed. To solve this problem, we
added this mechanism which allows programmers to add discardable
properties, which will be discarded automatically by the browser
if it's not accessed for a certain amount of time. </p>

<p>In order to add properties as discardable, programmers need to
package the data into a COM object which supports
IDiscardableBrowserProperty interface.
IDiscardableBrowserProperty interface is a dummy interface which
has no additional member to IUnknown. It does not even have the
interface definition. The programmer just need to responds to
QueryInteraface(IID_IDiscardableBrowserProperty) and returns its
IUnknown pointer. </p>

<p>When an ActiveX control store such a COM object as a
discadable property, it should call PutProperty method with a
GUID string to make it sure that the name is unique. When the
same type of ActiveX control on the following page need to get
that data, it should call GetProperty method with the same GUID
string. If it's not expired, it will successfully return the COM
object that is added by the first control. </p>
