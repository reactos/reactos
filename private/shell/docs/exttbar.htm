<h1>External Toolbar Layout Negotiation Mechanism</h1>

<p align="center">Last updated: 29 September 1996 -- satona</p>

<p>This document describes two interfaces we've introduced in the
IE 3.0 (Internet Explorer 3.0) to share the &quot;Internet Toolbar&quot;
implementation between two browser frames, IE 3.0 (a stand-alone
web browser) and IE 4.0 (the windows shell). Although I describe
this interface in this particular context, there is nothing
specific to this particular application or implementation in
these interfaces. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><em>Notes: IE 3.0 hosted only one toolbar, but IE 4.0 is
    going to host more than one (including the tree pane). The
    (private) interfaces we've introduced in IE 3.0 is not
    efficient for it. It requires to allocate a site for each
    toolbar. To avoid that inefficiency, we are changing the interface.
    All the member function calls to IDockingWindowSite takes an additiona
    parameter punkOuter, which identifies the toolbar. All the changes
    are marked in italic fonts. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the browser frame is created, it CoCreateInstance an
instance of the &quot;Internet Toolbar&quot; and attach it the
frame window. The browser frame implements the IDockingWindowSite interface
and the toolbar implements the IDockingWindow interface. Those interfaces
are used only for layout negotiation and accelerators and actual
navigation commands (that's what this particular toolbar does) is
sent via the OLE automation interface (IWebBrowserApp in this particular
case). </p>

<p>The idea is very similar to the toolbar layout negotiation
between in-place active object and in-place frame, but uses different
set of interfaces which are specific to the negotiation between
the frame and the toolbar that is not provided by the active
object. </p>

<p>In IE 4.0, we added another interface, IDockingWindowFrame,
which provides a way to add or remove toolbars programatically.
Both the <a href="webbar.htm">WebBar</a> and the DesktopChannel
(a vertical toolbar with channel change UI buttons) will use this
mechanism.</p>

<h3><a name="IDockingWindowFrame interface">IDockingWindowFrame
interface</a> (New IE 4.0)</h3>

<p>In addition to the standard &quot;Internet Toolbar&quot;, ISVs
(or ICPs) can add any toolbars (any COM objects which supports
IDockingWindow interface) to browser windows (including browser
window OCs, sub-frames in frame sets and the desktop window)
programatically. It will be done by (1) obtaining the
IDockingWindowFrame inteface via IServiceProvider::QueryService
(sid = SID_SShellBrowser for the immediate parent or SID_STopLevelBrowser
for the top-level browser), (2) then calling AddToolbar member with
a COM object, which supports IDockingWindow interface. Member
functions of IDockingWindowFrame are described below:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The <strong>AddToolbar</strong> member will attach the
        specified toolbar to the toolbar frame (e.g., IE browser
        window). When successfully attached, SetToolbarSite and
        ShowST member functions (of its IDockingWindow) will be
        called. It's important to note that the IDockingWindowSite
        object may or may not be the same as the
        IDockingWindowFrame object. Therefore, toolbars must
        establish the communication with the browser by the IDockingWindowSite interface
        passed via SetToolbarSite. </li>
    <li>The <strong>RemoveToolbar</strong> member will detach the
        specified toolbar from the site. CloseST and
        SetToolbarSite(NULL) will be called by the toolbar site. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="IDockingWindowSite interface">IDockingWindowSite
interface</a></h3>

<p>This interface is implemented by a frame window object, which
typically implements the IOleInPlaceUIWindow as well It inherits
IOleWindow, and it has four additional member functions,
GetBorderST, RequestBorderSpaceST, SetBorderSpaceST and OnFocusChange.
These member functions are always called by one of associated
toolbars. </p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>GetBorderST</strong>/<strong>RequestBorderSpaceST</strong>/<strong>SetBorderSpaceST</strong>:
        The definitions are exactly the same as corresponding
        methods in IOleInPlaceUIWindow. The prefix &quot;ST&quot; is
        added to allow C++ programmers to implement both
        interfaces in a single frame object. </li>
    <li><em>[New IE 4.0] </em>The <strong>OnFocusChangeST</strong>
        member will be called by the toolbar that is either
        getting or loosing the input focus. The frame will use
        this event to keep track of which toolbar has the focus. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="IDockingWindow interface">IDockingWindow interface</a></h3>

<p>This interface is implemented by a toolbar object, which
displays some tools within the border space of the frame window,
with which it is associated. This interface also inherits IOleWindow.
It has six additional member functions, SetToolbarSite, ShowST,
CloseST, ResizeBorderST, TranslateAcceleratorST and HasFocus. </p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>SetToolbarSite</strong> is called by the frame to
        establish the relationship between the frame and the
        toolbar object. The frame also calls SetToolbarSite with
        NULL when it is disconnecting the toolbar (typically when
        the frame is being closed). When SetToolbarSite(NULL) is
        called, the toolbar object must release all interface pointers obtained
        from the site (or frame). </li>
    <li><strong>ShowST</strong> is called by the frame with a
        Boolean parameter, indicating whether it should be shown
        or not. When being shown, the toolbar should get an
        appropriate border space (by calling IDockingWindowSite
        members) and make it visible filling the entire border
        space it acquired. When being hidden, it should make it
        invisible and return the border space by calling
        SetBorderSpaceST with 0s. </li>
    <li><strong>CloseST</strong> is called by the frame (before
        calling SetToolbarSite with NULL) when it is about
        disconnect the toolbar from the frame. If the toolbar has
        some global state to be persisted (to a registry or
        something), this is a good time to do it.</li>
    <li>ResizeBorderST is called by the frame when the border
        space has to be re-negotiated. It typically happens when
        the user changes the size of the entire frame window or another
        border space negotiation (which happens outside of the
        border rectangle for this toolbar) changed the border
        rectangle for this toolbar. </li>
    <li><strong>TranslateAcceleratorST</strong> is called by the
        frame only if the toolbar has the input focus.</li>
    <li><strong>HasFocus</strong> is called by the frame
        (typically from its message loop) to determine if it should
        call its TranslateAcceleratorST or not. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Notes">Notes</a></h3>

<p>TranslateAcceleratorST and HasFocus might need some
improvement if we are going to use these interfaces widely. </p>

<p>Not calling TranslateAcceleratorST at all when it does not
have the input focus simplifies the issue but there is a restriction.
There might be some cases where a toolbar wants to process a certain
set of accelerators even though it does not have the input focus
(of course, we need to worry about conflicts -- that's a general
problem with multiple UI components). </p>

<p>We found a case where the browser frame needs to be notified
when its toolbar (of one of its toolbars) gets the input focus
(to redirect OLECMDID_CUT/COPY/PASET commands via IOleCommandTarget
-- see another document <a href="editmenu.htm">&quot;DocObject:
Edit Menu command dispatching&quot;</a> for further discussion).
We probably needs to add OnSetFocus member for IDockingWindowSite
for this particular purpose. </p>

<p>IE 4.0 frame (the shell explorer) will probably support
multiple toolbars (the tree pane will be added as a toolbar). To implement
it under the current interfaces, the frame needs to have a IDockingWindowSite
for each toolbar, which is not efficient. We can avoid it by
adding a parameter to its member functions, which identifies the
toolbar. It can be an object pointer or a DWORD identifier (which
will be set by the frame via SetOwner). </p>
