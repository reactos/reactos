<h1>DocObject: Edit menu command dispatching</h1>
<p align=center>Last updated 20 Aug 1996 -- Satoshi Nakajima (satona)</p>
<p>This document describes a mechanism (no longer a proposal -- we have already implemented in IE 4.0) to solve an UI 
problem in IE 3.0. When the user selects something in the address bar (the edit box on the Internet toolbar) and pull 
down the Edit menu, the user expects that clipboard commands (cut, edit and paste) works with the selection in the 
address bar. It, however, does act on the selection in the client area (HTML Viewer). This is due to the fact that Edit 
menu is provided by the DocObject. OLE's menu negotiation scheme is not sufficient to handle this case. </p>
<p>This mechanism is based on a private mechanism for WordMail (&quot;Word as an e-mail editor) between WinWord and 
Exchange. We formalize that mechanism so that any DocObject servers and containers can participate. This mechanism 
requires some changes in both DocObject server side and the DocObject container side, but both remains compatible 
with old server/container.</p>
<h3>Code to be added to the DocObject server</h3>
<p>It keeps track of whether or not it should process the Edit-&gt;Cut/Copy/Paste commands. It should essentially keeps 
track of who has the input focus. If the DocObject itself (including one of DocObject toolbars or one of its children 
such as embeddings or OCs) has the input focus, those commands should be processed by the DocObject (assuming 
DocObject dispatches down to appropriate child). Otherwise (i.e., if one of the frame's toolbar has the focus), it should 
be processed by the the frame (i.e., DocObject container). </p>
<p>You might think it can be easily achieved by checking the focused window (by calling GetFocus()). It, unfortunately, 
does not work. When OLE set a window hook on the frame window (for menu dispatching), it sets the focus to the 
frame during the menu loop (and restores at the end). Therefore, GetFocus() while processing 
WM_ININTMENUPOPUP always returns the window handle of the frame window and DocObject can't tell anything 
from it. </p>
<p>To help the DocObject to keep track of the input focus correctly, the DocObject container notifies with 
OLECMDID_ONTOOLBARACTIVATED (a new command defined in docobj.odl) via IOleCommandTarget::Exec 
when one of its toolbar gets the focus. The DocObject typically sets an internal flag (let's call it 
<em>fDispathEditCommand</em>) indicating those clipboard commands should be dispatched to the frame when it receives one 
of them. It's strongly recommended to (1) UIDeactivate any child object and (2) hide the selection in the client area so 
that the user won't see two selections (one in the toolbar and another in the client area) at the same time. This flag will 
be reset by the DocObject itself when it (or one of its own toolbar or child windows) gets the focus back. Notice that 
we don't have OLECMDID_ONTOOLBARINACTIVATED because there is no way to distinguish 
WM_KILLFOCUS caused by OLE's window procedure hook (when the menu loop starts) from others. </p>
<p>Once it knows the state, the rest is easy. When it receives WM_INITMENUPOPUP for the Edit menu or 
WM_COMMAND for Cut/Copy/Paste commands while <em>fDispatchEditCommand</em> is set, it will get the 
IOleCommandTarget interface of the DocObject container (to be QI'ed from IOleInPlaceFrame) and call either 
QueryStatus or Exec appropriately (to enable/disable menu items or executes) with 
OLECMDID_CUT/COPY/PASTE. If the DocObject has Cut/Copy/Paste buttons on its own toolbar, it should 
enable/disable based on the same logic as well. Notice that the accelerators will be handled correctly via 
WM_COMMAND message dispatching. </p>
<h3>Code to be added to the DocObject container</h3>
<p>The container needs to do two things -- (1) sending OLECMDID_ONTOOLBARACTIVATED when one of its own 
toolbars (don't be confused with toolbars added by the DocObject) got the focus and (2) processing 
OLECMDID_CUT/COPY/PASTE in its IOleCommandTarget::Exec. Unlike OLECMD_PRINT, it should not call 
back the DocObject's IOleCommandTarget under any circumstance. If it has more than one (frame-owned) toolbars, it 
should keep track of which one has the focus last (again, remember that we can't rely on WM_KILLFOCUS) and 
dispatch commands to it. </p>
<h3>Header file change</h3>
<p>DocObj.H</p>
<p>#define OLECMDID_ONTOOLBARACTIVATED	31</p>

<p>(Internal memo -- not intended to be published in SDK)</p>
<p><strong>UI Notes:</strong> IOleCommandTarget has four more commands we could dispatch with this mechanism -- Undo, Redo, 
SelectAll and ClearSelection. We should carefully analyze the UI impact on this and do it only if it makes sense. </p>
<p><strong>Implementation Notes (MSHTML):</strong> To maintain <em>fDispatchEditCommand</em> flag correctly, the HTML viewer should 
do two things. When it receives OLECMDID_ONTOOLBARACTIVATED, it should make the top-level HTML 
document active (to UIDeactivate the currently active one), hide the selection and set the <em>fDispatchEditCommand</em> 
flag. HTML viewer should reset the <em>fDispatchEditCommand</em> flag either when it receives the WM_SETFOCUS 
message or when its OnUIActivate is called (by one of its child).</p>
<p><strong>Implementation Notes (SHDOCVW): </strong>To support multiple toolbars correctly, the IE frame should have a mechanism 
to dispatch IOleCommandTarget correctly. I took a very straightforward implementation. I have added the 
IOleCommandTarget interface to the toolbar(s) (in addition to IDockingWindow) and dispatching those commands to the 
one which currently has the input focus (the last one which called the IDockingWindowSite::OnFocusChange). Each toolbar 
just calls IDockingWindowSite::OnFocusChange when it got the input focus.</p>
