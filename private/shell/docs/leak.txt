- overview
... blah blah blah ...

you might want to read the 'cookbook' and 'examples' section 1st to make
stuff a bit more concrete.

- framework: leaks, annotations, and analysis
a leak is simply memory that has been alloc'ed and never free'ed.  our
debug allocator keeps a list of all alloc's.  on exit anything left in
the list is considered a leak.

all of our mechanisms piggy-back off of this leak-tracking framework.
    an event (such as an allocation or a QI) is hooked.
    we put extra annotations about the event into some alloc'ed memory
    on exit, annotations are recognized as 'special' leaks
    we analyze the annotations and dump them out

this is the basic framework.  it, together w/ the per-object annotations
and the analysis we do when we dump the leak list, comprises intelli-leak.

- annotations
for a memory leak the annotation is simply a ptr, size, and location.

for an iface leak the annotation is a 'QIStub'.  a QIStub is a proxy
object which is created for a QI call.  when QIStubs are on, our (utility)
QISearch helper creates a proxy object for every non-IUnknown iface it
returns.  the proxy forwards all calls to the real object but has some
annotations.  any such proxy object which is not eventually Release'ed
will show up in the leak list.

[caveat: since every QI for a non-IUnknown gets a new proxy object, ptrs
can only be compared using IsSameObject.  often when turning on qistubs
for the 1st time in a while one will hit bugs due to illegal ptr compares]

this is the basic framework.  that, together w/ the annotation and the
analysis we do when we dump the leak list, comprises intelli-leak.

- stubs
the annotation info in a stub includes:
    cRef -- ref count
    iSeq -- sequence #
    iid -- the IID of the QI
    caller -- the caller of QI

cRef is usually 1, since we create a new stub per QI call.  (an explicit
AddRef will increment it in place rather than create a new stub).

iSeq is the sequence # for the iface.  this tells exactly which QI for an
iface failed, which in turn permits brkpt'ing on that call in a 2nd run
of the same scenario (assuming it's repro'able).

iid is the iface we've QI'ed for.

caller is the 'interesting' caller (or as close as we can come).  a
typical call graph looks like:
    foo -> thisclass::QI -> super::QI -> ... -> super::QI
we skip over all of the (known) QI's and give 'foo'.  sometimes even
this isn't enough, e.g. when 'foo' is a 'create instance' or a
'constructor' call.  in that case use iSeq and a debugger to get
more info.

- analysis
on exit we analyze the set of leaks and annotate things further.

usually you just have one 'real' root leak but it references some friends
and each of them reference some friends and so on and so on and so on and
pretty soon you have a page full of leaks to wade thru.

we build a graph of inter-leak dependencies (using a fairly reliable
heuristic) and use that to identify the root leak and all the links.

the heuristic is to look at every DWORD in a given leak and see if it
points to (the base of) any other leak.  if so, it's assumed to be a
link.

To avoid debugger breaks during the heuristic phase, type "sxd av"
before hitting "g".

- dumps
the generic object dumper is a 'dword dumper', which is quite painful
to read.

we identify each object (using a fairly reliable heuristic), label it
symbolically (e.g. w/ a type name or iface name), and dump it w/ a
custom dumper if one exists.

currently the only custom dumper is for ifaces.  we dump the IID in
symbolic form (e.g. IID_FooBar) and dump the other fields.

[since we dump the ptr and the type, the ntsd dumper extensions can be
used to fully dump any known struct]

the current heuristics are as follows:
    for QIStubs, we see if the size matches and if the 2nd vtbl entry
    is CQIStub::AddRef; if so, it's a QIstub.  this is quite reliable.

    for other classes, we have a table of SIZEOF's.  if the size matches,
    we assume it's the class.  this is a bit crude and will sometimes
    give false hits.  if that turns out to be a pblm we can improve it.

- debug hooks
QISearch (etc.) hook various interesting events.  by patching magic debug
variables and putting brkpts on magic debug funcs, you can drop into the
debugger at key interesting points.

the most interesting of these is:
    brk on the 'seq'th QI for iface 'iid'

other events include:
    brk on successful (failed) QI for iface 'iid'
    TODO: various other less interesting events

- cookbook
    steps 3 thru the end are tagged in the 'example' section below.  look
    for 'step-3' etc. to find them.

    step-1. realize you have a leak
    - debug explorer
    - start IE
    - leak shown on exit

    step-2. turn on stubs
    - turn on QIStubs
        [SHDOCVW]
            DumpFlags=0x04
    - shutdown/restart explorer under debugger

    step-3. reset and get iid/seq
    - 'F12' into debugger
    - patch some things:
        ed dbqifreset 1         // this will reset seq#'s to 0
    - start IE
    - (same) leak shown on exit
        e.g.:
            leak=0xc2548,44(IID_IDeskBand)
                created from 0x71574ed3
                qistub(c2548): cRef=0x1 iSeq=a iid=IID_IDeskBand
                ref=root ***
       (items marked as "ref=root ***" are roots)
    - find root leak IID and seq#
        if you just caused the leak possibly this alone will tell you 
        enough.  if not, read on...
    - 'g'

    step-4. reset and brkpt on iid/seq
    - 'F12' into debugger
    - patch some things
        ed dbqifreset 1         // reset again
        u IID_FooBar l 1        // find &-of IID_FooBar
        ed dbqiiid <&iid>       // iid we want to track
        ed dbqiiseq <seq#>      // seq#
        bp DBBrkpt              // this is what we call

    - 'g'

    step-5. hit the brkpt
    - start IE
    - you'll hit your brkpt on DBBrkpt
        - figure out what's going on
        in this case we see that the leak is from _GetInfoBandBS calling
        IECreateInst.  there must be a missing Release (indeed there is,
        i commented it out for my test)

- example
see 'appendix: example'

- miscellany
much of the above is x86 only.  while it could be ported (but probably
not written portably), it isn't currently deemed worth the effort.  most
leaks will be 'portable' and will manifest everywhere and thus can be
debugged on x86.

currently intelli-leak is only in shdocvw.  probably the most interesting
(and highly leveraged!) next step would be to move the code to shlwapi so
other components can use it too.  the code was written w/ the intent to
make it a shared service so it should be pretty easy to do so.
    the data-gathering, stub, and breakpointing code has minimal external
    dependencies (see qistub.cpp).

    the client-side hooks (e.g. 'operator new') also are fairly stand-
    alone (see olestuff.cpp).

    the analysis code drives off of the leak list and thus is dependent on
    it (see olestuff.cpp).

- FAQs
q: i turn on QIStubs and i fault.
a: since every QI for a non-IUnknown gets a new proxy object, ptrs can only
be compared using IsSameObject.  often when turning on qistubs for the 1st
time in a while one will hit bugs due to illegal ptr compares

q: why are there '// IID_IFooBar' comments next to every QITABENT in my QI?
a: these are the only way a 'grep' for IID_IFooBar will show you the
implementor.

q: i get "?debdump.c!DBGetClassSymbolic" rather than a symbolic name
a: add your class to the table in shell/xxx/debdump.cpp!DBClassInfoTab

q: i get "{guid}" rather than a symbolic name
a: add your GUID to the table in lib/dump.c!c_mpriid

q: intelli-dump gives exceptions when i'm in the debugger
a: do "sxd av" to skip 1st-chance exceptions before hitting 'g'

q: sometimes leaks show up on the 'base' object rather than on the 'real'
leaked iface.
a: various things can cause this, including: 
    x->SetAdvise(..., this);
    // which is equivalent to this:
    p = SAFECAST(this, Ifoo *);     // callER
    p->AddRef();                    // callEE
note that this is bogus code if you have tearoff ifaces...

- credits
satona invented the original custom client-side QIStubs.

andyp invented QISearch, automatic server-side QIStubs, automatic
sequence #'ing, intelli-leak dumps, and brkpt'ing.

mikesh worked out a bunch of details and implemented server-side stubs.

cheechew consulted on interesting scenarios for dumps and debugging, esp.
dependencies and brkpt'ing.

kurte is currently moving stuff into shell32.  one pblm he has run into
is that we need single 'global' leak and known-QI tables rather than
per-DLL ones, while we need separate 'local' custom dump tables.  he's
making those changes.

ole chose the AddRef/Release architecture, and all of us use it to create
leaks, thus motivating leak detection. :-)

apologies to anyone i've forgotten...
