<h2>IE 4.0 : Browser Bar Extension Mechanism</h2>

<p>This document describes one of new features of IE 4.0, which
is called &quot;BrowserBar Extension&quot;, which allows
programmers to &quot;add&quot; a UI component to either the
explorer/communication bar of each browser window or one of
DeskBars of the desktop. </p>

<p>In order to add a pane to one of toolbars in the browser, you
need to register a CLSID of the pane which supports an
appropriate component category (CATID_InfoBand for a pane in
communication bar, CATID_CommBand for one in the communication
bar ir CATUD_DeskBand for one in DeskBars).</p>

<p>When the browser window is created, it enumerates all the
CLSIDs in each component category and add them to the menu (in
View-&gt;ExplorerBar submenu for the browser and Toolbar submenu
for the desktop). The creation of the instance is delayed until
the user select it (or programmatically opened). The instances of
those CLSIDs are called <em>band objects</em>. </p>

<p>Each band object must implement IDeskBand (for layout
negotiation) and IInPutObject (for input/focus management) which
are essential to become a pane in a browser window. Optionally,
it may support IPersistStream (for persistence) and
IOleCommandTarget (to handle Edit menu). </p>

<p>To help non-progammers (or web-programmers) to add HTML-based
pane, IE 4 has an implementation of a band object, a browser
band, which hosts arbitrary web-pages specified by an URL. To add
such a band, you need to (1) generate a unique CLSID and (2)
register that CLSID with following registry keys:</p>

<pre>HKEY_CLASSES</pre>

<pre>    CLSID</pre>

<pre>        {<em>generated clsid</em>}</pre>

<pre>            Implemented Categories</pre>

<pre>                (default) = &quot;<em>{CATID_CommBand}</em>&quot;</pre>

<pre>            InProcServer32 </pre>

<pre>                (default) = &quot;shdocvw.dll&quot;</pre>

<pre>            Instance</pre>

<pre>                CLSID = &quot;{<em>CLSID_BrowserBand</em>}&quot;</pre>

<pre>                PropertyBag</pre>

<pre>                    (URL) = &quot;<em>initializing url</em>&quot;</pre>
