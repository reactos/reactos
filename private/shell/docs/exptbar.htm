<h1>IE 4.0 Shell Toolbar Extension mechanism</h1>

<h3>Overview: </h3>

<p>IE 3.0 introduced the internet toolbar (or
&quot;coolbar&quot;) which is suitable for browsing, which is
quite different from the Win95 shell's explorer toolbar. This two
different toolbar was not a problem until we integrates the
browser functionality into the explorer in IE 4.0. First, we
tried it with two separate toolbars (from which the user can
choose), but we've received many negative feedback against it
from users. It became clear for us that we need to merge two
toolbar into one. This document describes a proposed toolbar
extension mechanism which allows us to have a single toolbar
which is suitable for both with shell type folders (directories,
my computer, control panel) and web pages. </p>

<p>Since we need to achieve this in a very short development time
frame, it's very important to know exactly what are our goals:</p>

<ul>
    <li>We change buttons only on the first pane of the toolbar
        depending on the shell view type.</li>
    <li>Common buttons (Back and Forward) stays on left,
        additional buttons will be placed on right. </li>
    <li>We allow only buttons (including buttons with menu) to be
        added. No other controls can be added.</li>
    <li>Although we hide that fact from the folder side, the
        merge will happen only with the default toolbar we
        provide.</li>
    <li>The only top-level shell view can participate in this
        negotiation (a folder in a frame set can't).</li>
    <li>Achieve smooth toolbar transitions between HTML Views and
        Shell folder views.</li>
    <li>We support Win95 type toolbar extension mechanism but it
        can be limited.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mechanism:</h3>

<p>UI negotiation will be performed between a shell view
(IShellView) and a shell browser (IShellBrowser). We introduce
one new interface (IExplorerToolbar) to perform UI negotiation,
one new service GUID (SID_SExplorerToolbar) to help finding the
service, and use one existing interface (IOleCommandTarget from
ActiveX document interfaces) to invoke commands.</p>

<ol>
    <li>When a shell view is being UIActivated, it gets the
        IExplorerToolbar interface to the toolbar by calling
        IServiceProvider::QueryService with SID_SExplorerToobar. </li>
    <li>Then, when the shell browser gets created, it calls
        IExplorerToolbar::<strong>SetCommandTarget</strong> with
        the following parameters: <br>
        <em>SetCommandTarget(IUnknown* </em><em><strong>punkCmdTarget</strong></em><em>,
        const GUID* </em><em><strong>pguidButtonGroup</strong></em><em>,
        DWORD </em><em><strong>dwFlags</strong></em><em>)</em>;<br>
        punkCmdTarget is the IOleCommandTarget interface to it's
        command target interface<br>
        pguidButtonGroup is a unique GUID to identify the group
        of buttons<br>
        dwFlags specifies which bands in the coolbar should be
        visible and how many lines of text the toolbar should
        have.. <br>
        Calling SetCommandTarget will establish a direct
        connection from the toolbar to the shell view (or its
        sub-component). </li>
    <li>Then, it calls IExplorerToolbar::<strong>AddButtons</strong>
        (typically) multiple times to add buttons to the toolbar.
        It specifies its command ID (to be passed to
        IOleCommandTarget along with pguidButtonGroup), glyphs
        (normal and highlighted) and button text (to be displayed
        right below the button). AddButton takes a GUID as an
        argument (the same GUID to be passed to
        SetCommandTarget), but it won't be used in this version
        -- it's for future enhancement. </li>
    <li>Above negotiation will give enough information for the
        toolbar to display those additional buttons. Those
        buttons will be enabled or disabled based on the return
        value from IOleCmdTarget::QueryStatus.</li>
    <li>When the user moves the mouse over to one of those
        buttons, the toolbar calls IOleCmdTarget::QueryStatus to
        get the tooltip text (which is longer than the button
        text).</li>
    <li>When the user clicks one of those buttons, the toolbar
        calls IOleCmdTarget::Exec. To make it easy to implement a
        pull-down menu effect, it passes the position of the
        button's left-bottom corner in screen coordinate. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Cook book for new clients:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Call SetCommandTarget () to register the it's
        IOleCmdTarget and guidButtonGroup</li>
    <li>Call GetBitmapSize() to find out the size coolbar expects
        for the Bitmaps</li>
    <li>Call AddBitmaps giving HINST of the DLL and the resource
        ID or the Glyphs. This will return the Glyph offset</li>
    <li>Call AddStrings giving HINST of the DLL and the resource
        ID or the Strings. This will return the String offset</li>
    <li>AddButtons() specifying appropriate Glyph and String
        offsets</li>
    <li>Use GetButton(), GetState(), SetState() to manipulate the
        buttons</li>
    <li>Ensure that IOleCmdTarget::QueryStatus is supported. It
        will be called to get button states and tooltip strings</li>
    <li>Ensure that IOleCmdTarget::Exec is supported. It will be
        called when the user clicks on a button.</li>
