#
#    - replace the xxxxx in the MAJORCOMP= and MINORCOMP= macros below
#      with your components major and minor component name
#      (e.g. MAJORCOMP=ntos, MINORCOMP=ke etc.).
#
#    - replace the xxxxx in the TARGETNAME= macro below with your target name
#      (e.g. OS2, POSIX, PM, etc.).
#
#    - edit the TARGETPATH= and TARGETTYPE= macros below to specify the location
#      any type of the target.
#
#    - edit the INCLUDES= macro below if you have a private include directory
#      to search.
#
#    - carefully edit the SOURCES= macro below so that it defines all the source
#      files for this subcomponent
#
#    - edit out these noisy instructions and all comments
#
#    - save this file, exit the editor and execute the "build" command.
#
#    - From now on, issue build or nmake to build the subcomponent.

#
# The MAJORCOMP and MINORCOMP variables are defined
# so that $(MAJORCOMP)$(MINORCOMP)filename can be used in
# cross compiling to provide unique filenames in a flat namespace.
#

# MAJORCOMP=xxxxx
# MINORCOMP=xxxxx

#
# The TARGETNAME variable is defined by the developer.  It is the name of
# the target (component) that is being built by this makefile.  It
# should NOT include any path or file extension information.
#

TARGETNAME=walk


#
# The TARGETPATH and TARGETTYPE variables are defined by the developer.
# The first specifies where the target is to be build.  The second specifies
# the type of target (either PROGRAM, DYNLINK, LIBRARY, DRIVER, etc
# UMAPPL_NOLIB is used when you're only building user-mode
# apps and don't need to build a library.
#

TARGETPATH=obj
TARGETTYPE=PROGRAM


#
# The TARGETLIBS specifies additional libraries to link with you target
# image.  Each library path specification should contain an asterisk (*)
# where the machine specific subdirectory name should go.
#

TARGETLIBS= $(SDK_LIB_PATH)\shell32.lib \
            $(SDK_LIB_PATH)\ole32.lib   \

# USE_MFC = 1
# MFC_VER = 42


#
# The INCLUDES variable specifies any include paths that are specific to
# this source directory.  Separate multiple directory paths with single
# semicolons.  Relative path specifications are okay.
#

# INCLUDES=..\inc


#
# The SOURCES variable is defined by the developer.  It is a list of all the
# source files for this component.  Each source file should be on a separate
# line using the line continuation character.  This will minimize merge
# conflicts if two developers adding source files to the same component.
#

SOURCES= stdafx.cpp \
         idlist.cpp \
         walk.cpp   \

# Next specify options for the compiler.

#
# Next specify a kernel mode test (valid only in NTOS tree)

#
# Next specify one or more user mode test programs and their type
# UMTEST is used for optional test programs.  UMAPPL is used for

#
# Defining either (or both) the variables NTTARGETFILE0 and/or NTTARGETFILES
# will cause MAKEFILE.DEF to include .\makefile.inc immediately after it
# specifies the top level targets (all, clean and loc) and their dependencies.
# MAKEFILE.DEF also expands NTTARGETFILE0 as the first dependent for the
# "all" target and NTTARGETFILES as the last dependent for the "all" target.
# Useful for specifying additional targets and dependencies that don't fit the
# general case covered by MAKEFILE.DEF
#
