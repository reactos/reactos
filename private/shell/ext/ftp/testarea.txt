Here is the format for an FTP URL:
----------------------------------
ftp://<UserName>:<Password>@<ServerName>:<PortNum>/<Dir1>/...<SubDirs>/<FileName.txt>:type=<a|b>

UserName - [Optional] On WinNT, this can include "domain\username" and the '\' is entered as "%5c" in escaped form to get past the URL format.
Password - [Optional] Obvious.  Later I will handle displaying a dialog to enter the password when it wasn't given in the url.
Server - [Required] Intranet Machine Name, Internet DNS Name, or IP addr.
Port - [Optional] Defaults to 21.  You can test by changing IIS.
SubDir - [Optional] Needs to end in a '/' or I assume it's a file. (Hitting the server is too expensive)  
	Having a file extension will affect this.  This is always relative to the Virtual Root directory 
	if the server has a Virtual Root for that user.  If you log into bryanst2 with bryanst2\JoeMama, 
	your virtual Dir is (\user\JoeMama\).  ftp://bryanst2%5cJoeMama:pass@bryanst2/SubDir1/ will be 
	/user/JoeMama/SubDir1/ on the server.  Original IE makes all SubDirs in the URL ralative to the
	base (not Virtual Root), so these are incompatible.  I use the new way, because that follows the
	FTP spec.  This is why I have "Correct Url" and "Incorrect Url" in the test web pages.  You will
	find that IE4's original FTP support works correctly with URL w/o files (i.e. Directories).

	Virtual Root = /Users/Sales/User1/
	File /Users/Sales/User1/SubDir1/file.txt
	New FTP File URL: ftp://User1:Pass@Serv/SubDir1/file.txt
	New FTP Dir URL:  ftp://User1:Pass@Serv/SubDir1/
	IE4 FTP File URL: ftp://User1:Pass@Serv/Users/Sales/User1/SubDir1/file.txt
	IE4 FTP Dir URL:  ftp://User1:Pass@Serv/Users/Sales/User1/SubDir1/

FileName - [Optional] Test files with and w/o extensions.
Type - [Optional] A mean download in ASCII.  The other is either B[inary] or I[mage], which means download in binary.  Right now, I only support B, but I may also may be needed.


Test Areas:
===========
1. Drag & Drop
-------------------
1.1 Successful single file, single folder, files and folders, files and folders recursively.
1.2 Use Copy/Paste instead of Drag/Drop.
1.3 Use these as Drop Targets: Email message, File System Folder, Ftp Folder on Same Server (SubDir), Ftp Folder
        on another server, Internet Explorer (can display dropped html file), Name Space Extensions (like Fonts Folder,
        ActiveX Control Cache, WinZip).
1.4 Use the following as Drag Sources: Email Message, Internet Shortcuts on web page, gif from web page w/o HREF,
    file system folder, UNC path, from my computer, brief case, recycle bin, WordPad (drag a scrap to an FTP Site).

1.5 Error cases: Dest Dir Full, No Write, Full of connections, Proxy blocks action.
1.6 Test using Exchange or similar drag target or drag source that doesn't use a file system for storage. (Outlook Express, Eudora?)


2. Platforms
-------------------
2.1 Win95 w/IE 5 (Bld 201 or Newer) - Browser Only
2.2 WinNT 4 w/IE 5 (Bld 201 or Newer) - Browser Only

    Subject: The great thing about standards...
    RFC959, the spec for FTP, says that the response to the "SYST" command must be
    a string whose first token is on the list of operating systems maintained by the
    Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (i.e., the people who are authorized to do
    these sorts of things). Now, one of the official "operating systems" is called
    WIN32, which means that "this FTP site follows WIN32 long file name semantics".
    Not to be confused with "MSDOS", which means "FAT semantics", or "UNIX" which
    means "case-sensitive, arbitrary length, only slashes disallowed" or "UNIX-BSD"
    which means "case-sensitive, maximum 14 characters, only slashes disallowed",
    or "TOPS20" which means "God help you".  If you ask ftp.microsoft.com what
    operating system it is using, it reports "Windows_NT" instead of "WIN32". 
    I go down the list of "official" operating systems, find that "Windows_NT"
    isn't on the list, and assert "Unrecognized operating system on the other
    end; assuming UNIX".  And then I think that the guy on the other side uses
    case-sensitive filenames and get confused when it doesn't...  That's the
    great thing about standards. By ignoring them, you make it impossible for
    your own developers to write stuff that uses them...
