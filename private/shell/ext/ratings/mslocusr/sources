Module Name:

    sources.

Abstract:

    This file specifies the target component being built and the list of
    sources files needed to build that component.  Also specifies optional
    compiler switches and libraries that are unique for the component being
    built.

# The MAJORCOMP and MINORCOMP variables are defined

# cross compiling to provide unique filenames in a flat namespace.

#
# The TARGETNAME variable is defined by the developer.  It is the name of
# the target (component) that is being built by this makefile.  It
# should NOT include any path or file extension information.
#

TARGETNAME=mslocusr


#
# The TARGETPATH and TARGETTYPE variables are defined by the developer.
# The first specifies where the target is to be build.  The second specifies
# the type of target (either PROGRAM, DYNLINK, LIBRARY, UMAPPL_NOLIB or
# BOOTPGM).  UMAPPL_NOLIB is used when you're only building user-mode
# apps and don't need to build a library.

# The TARGETLIBS specifies additional libraries to link with you target
# image.  Each library path specification should contain an asterisk (*)
# where the machine specific subdirectory name should go.

# The SOURCES variable is defined by the developer.  It is a list of all the
# source files for this component.  Each source file should be on a separate
# line using the line continuation character.  This will minimize merge
# conflicts if two developers adding source files to the same component.

# Defining either (or both) the variables NTTARGETFILE0 and/or NTTARGETFILES
# will cause MAKEFILE.DEF to include .\makefile.inc immediately after it
# specifies the top level targets (all, clean and loc) and their dependencies.
# MAKEFILE.DEF also expands NTTARGETFILE0 as the first dependent for the
# "all" target and NTTARGETFILES as the last dependent for the "all" target.
# Useful for specifying additional targets and dependencies that don't fit the
# general case covered by MAKEFILE.DEF
