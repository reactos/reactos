# ReactOS AMD64 Kernel - Remaining Work

## Current Status
The ReactOS AMD64 kernel successfully boots through Phase 0, Phase 1, and minimal Phase 2 initialization. The kernel is stable and running in its idle loop.

### Completed Work
✅ Fixed InitializeListHead macro issues for AMD64
✅ Fixed cross-module function calls using inline assembly
✅ Initialized HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)
✅ Set up basic Memory Manager structures
✅ Configured SharedUserData
✅ Implemented kernel idle loop
✅ Achieved "ReactOS AMD64 KERNEL BOOT COMPLETE" status

## Remaining Work - Priority Order

### 1. I/O Manager Initialization (CRITICAL - CURRENT FOCUS)
- **Status**: Deferred due to complex dependencies
- **Issues**:
  - Cross-module calls to IoInitSystem failing
  - UEFI-specific device enumeration needed
  - File system stack not initialized
  - Device object creation not working
- **Required**:
  - Fix IoInitSystem for AMD64 with large memory model
  - Initialize UEFI boot device
  - Set up file system recognizer
  - Enable driver loading framework

### 2. Object Manager Initialization
- **Status**: Deferred
- **Issues**:
  - ObInitSystem cross-module call failing
  - Object directory structure not created
  - Security descriptors not initialized
- **Required**:
  - Create root object directory
  - Initialize object types
  - Set up namespace

### 3. Memory Manager Full Initialization
- **Status**: Partially complete (Phase 0 only)
- **Issues**:
  - Pool management not fully initialized
  - Page fault handler not installed
  - Virtual memory system not active
- **Required**:
  - Initialize paged and non-paged pools
  - Set up working set manager
  - Enable demand paging

### 4. Process Manager Initialization
- **Status**: Basic structures only
- **Issues**:
  - PsInitSystem not called
  - System process (PsIdleProcess) not fully created
  - Thread scheduling not active
- **Required**:
  - Create System process properly
  - Initialize process/thread structures
  - Enable scheduler

### 5. Configuration Manager (Registry)
- **Status**: Not started
- **Issues**:
  - CmInitSystem not called
  - No registry hives loaded
  - SYSTEM hive required for boot
- **Required**:
  - Load SYSTEM registry hive
  - Initialize registry namespace
  - Enable registry access APIs

### 6. Security Reference Monitor
- **Status**: Not started
- **Issues**:
  - SeInitSystem not called
  - No security contexts
  - Access checks disabled
- **Required**:
  - Initialize security subsystem
  - Create system security context
  - Enable access checking

### 7. Plug and Play Manager
- **Status**: Not started
- **Issues**:
  - PnP manager not initialized
  - No device enumeration
  - UEFI devices not discovered
- **Required**:
  - Initialize PnP subsystem
  - Enumerate UEFI boot devices
  - Start device drivers

### 8. Executive Process Creation
- **Status**: Not started
- **Issues**:
  - Cannot create user-mode processes
  - Session Manager (smss.exe) cannot start
  - No subsystem initialization
- **Required**:
  - Enable process creation
  - Load and start smss.exe
  - Initialize Win32 subsystem

### 9. Driver Loading Framework
- **Status**: Not functional
- **Issues**:
  - Boot drivers not loaded
  - Driver initialization routines not called
  - DriverEntry not executed
- **Required**:
  - Load boot-start drivers
  - Initialize driver objects
  - Call driver entry points

### 10. UEFI-Specific Requirements
- **Status**: Partially addressed
- **Issues**:
  - UEFI runtime services not mapped
  - UEFI boot services still active (should be terminated)
  - ACPI tables not processed
- **Required**:
  - Map UEFI runtime services
  - Process ACPI tables
  - Set up UEFI virtual address map

## Critical Path to Desktop Boot

1. **I/O Manager** → Required for all file operations
2. **Object Manager** → Required for namespace
3. **Memory Manager Phase 1** → Required for pool allocations
4. **Process Manager** → Required for process creation
5. **Registry** → Required for system configuration
6. **Session Manager** → First user-mode process
7. **Win32 Subsystem** → Required for GUI
8. **Explorer Shell** → Desktop interface

## Technical Challenges for AMD64

### Large Memory Model Issues
- Function pointers require special handling
- RIP-relative addressing limited to ±2GB
- Import Address Table (IAT) issues with -mcmodel=large
- Need trampolines or PLT stubs for cross-module calls

### UEFI vs Legacy BIOS
- Different device enumeration model
- UEFI runtime services require special handling
- GOP (Graphics Output Protocol) instead of VGA
- Different memory map format

### 64-bit Specific
- Different calling convention (RCX, RDX, R8, R9 for first 4 params)
- Red zone must be disabled (-mno-red-zone)
- Stack alignment requirements (16-byte)
- GS segment used for processor control region

## Next Steps - I/O Manager Focus

The I/O Manager is the most critical subsystem to fix next because:
1. Required for loading any files (including smss.exe)
2. Needed for driver framework
3. Essential for device management
4. Prerequisite for most other subsystems

### I/O Manager Fix Strategy
1. Implement IoInitSystem inline to avoid cross-module issues
2. Create minimal device object for boot device
3. Initialize file system recognizer
4. Enable IRP (I/O Request Packet) processing
5. Set up driver object structures
