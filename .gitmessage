# Commit message example
# ----------------------
# [MODULE] A short but descriptive summary (#pr-num)
#
# A comprehensible description of WHY you did this work. Do not limit
# yourself here.
# The width of the description is arbitary, but it is a good idea to
# wrap the text by 72 chars.
#
# CORE-XXXX CIDXXXXX
# ----------------------
# * [MODULE] should usually be the name of the CMake module, written
#   in all caps.
# * Summary should be imperative (not past tense) and not end with a
#   period.
# * Description of a commit should explain WHY a change was made.
# * JIRA, Coverity ID references should be placed at the bottom row.
# * There must be a newline between summary, description and bug IDs.
# * GitHub Pull Request ID should be referenced in the summary in
#   parens. If the resulting summary is longer than 70 chars it may
#   be placed last in the ID row to prevent hard wrapping on GitHub.
