                               RELEASE NOTES:
                               --------------

This release of TELNET is a beta one. This means that it is working as far
as it is tested, and has a few bugs. Hopefully this will be a stable
version.  Please send comments and bug reports to me at
pbranna@clemson.edu, or to the mailing list (see below).  See file
CHANGES.TXT for a detailed log of changes.  See file BUGS.TXT for known
bugs.

                                DESCRIPTION:
                                ------------

This is a telnet client with full color ANSI support for Windows NT/95
console. You can use this program from the Win95 command line (MsDos) and
run it in full screen text mode. You may also redirect the telnet session
to STDIN and STDOUT for use with other programs.  Telnet will communicate
the number of lines and rows to the host, and can operate in any console
mode.  Most of it's options are customizable.

                                HOW TO HELP:
                                ------------

Telnet is a free project made from volunteers. If you know C/C++ and would
like to help in the development you are welcome :-)  Just contact
pbranna@clemson.edu, and/or subscribe to the mailing list.  Check
ftp://argeas.cs-net.gr/Telnet-Win32/devel for a recent alpha version.


                                INSTALLATION
                                ------------

Just copy telnet.exe, telnet.ico, telnet.ini and keys.cfg to a directory.
I prefer a directory included in the PATH (such as C:\WINDOWS, but this will
overwrite the telnet that comes with Windows -- which is not necessarily a
bad thing). If you are upgrading from a previous version please look below
(Key file definitions) : the keys.cfg file has changed a bit. Also look at
the Configuration section below, TELNET now has a ini file.

                                   USAGE:
                                   -------

  TELNET
    Begins telnet and enters telnet> command line.

  TELNET [params][host [port]]
    Connects to port on host. Port defaults to 23 for TELNET.

    params    -d FILENAME.EXT    Dumps all incoming data to FILENAME.EXT
                                 Note lowercase 'd'.
              --variable=value   Overrides ini variable to be set to value.

    host                         Host name or IP to connect to
    port                         Service port to open connection on
                                 (default is telnet port 23).

  TELNET -?
    Gives usage information.

Pressing the escape key (default ALT-]) will break out of a telnet session and
return you to the telnet> prompt. Pressing return will resume your session.
All the options are available from the telnet> prompt. Type ? to get help.

Pressing the scrollback key (default ALT-[) will give you a basic scrollback
view. Pressing ESC will resume your session.

                                   BUGS:
                                   -----

There are :-). Hopefully this version is more stable than the previous. See
BUGS.TXT, and grep for FIX ME's in the sources. Any help ?

                                   NOTES:
                                   ------

If the environment variable LANG has a valid value (e.g. LANG=de for German
characters) and the file LOCALE.DLL is installed somewhere along the PATH
TELNET will not ignore local characters.

If you have problems with paste under Win 95 try unchecking the fast paste
option in the MsDos properties. The paste function works correctly under NT.
This is a Microsoft bug :-)

                                CONFIGURATION
                                -------------

The configuration is made through telnet.ini and keys.cfg. These files (at
least telnet.ini) must be in the same directory which telnet.exe is.  The
basic options are loaded from the file telnet.ini. If you are having problems
with a terminal setting, check the file OPTIONS.TXT for configuration
information.


Key file definitions (telnet.cfg)
-------------------------------

Use the key file (telnet.cfg) to define the characters that telnet is sending
to the host.  From version 2b5 you can configure the output keys (KEYMAP
sections), the input character translations (CHARMAP sections) and you can
combine all to as many configurations as you like (CONFIG sections). You
can also have alternative keymaps in a configuration, and keys to switch
between them.  See the comments in keys.cfg for details.

NOTE: if you are upgrading from a previous version you must put your old keys
in the KEYMAP sections.
Please send any national specific keymaps / charmaps / configurations to be
included to the next version.


                              HOW TO COMPILE IT
                             -------------------

Telnet compiles with a variety of compilers.  You will need at least
Borland 4.x or newer compiler, or MSVC 2.0 or newer, or download a version
of gcc for Win32 (see https://web.archive.org/web/20010126054500/http://www.musc.edu/~brannanp/telnet/gccwin32.html).
Copy the files from the directories BORLAND or MSVC to the main directory,
change them to fit to your system, and recompile.  The project comes with
IDE files and makefiles.

Follow the instructions for your compiler to compile telnet.  A Makefile
for use with mingw32 or other gcc variants has been included, so if you have
gcc, you can just type "make" at the command line.

                               SPECIAL THANKS:
                               ---------------
