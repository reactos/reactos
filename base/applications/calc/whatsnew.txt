1.12 (20181104)
=======================
* Fixed bug 12.37 13/06/2009 into multiprecision display (unicode only).
* Added support for average of squares and mean of squares into statistical functions.
* pop() and push() functions in RPN engines now work with nodes instead of stack units.
* Updated translations from ReactOS' repository.
* Added support for new conversion units:
   - ANGLE: 'minute of arc', 'second of arc'.
   - AREA: 'mu', 'rai'.
   - LENGTH: 'chi', 'cun'. 'sun' optimized.
   - TIME: 'nanoseconds'.
   - WEIGHT: 'Kan', 'Kin'.
* Added support for thailand measure system:

  Invaluable help from this page:
  http://www.eppo.go.th/ref/UNIT-ALL.html

* Moved the POW and SQR operations near the operators.
* Rewritten some units formula by using scientific notation.
* Improved precision of parsec unit conversion formula.
* Fixed bug when calculator was closed with statistics dialog open.
* Do not append decimal separator if "ERROR" messages are printed.
* Improve code readability by using SetDlgItemText and GetDlgItemText functions
* Colours are now declared though RGB() macro.
* Remove call to _tcslen() and use return value of GetDlgItemText() where possible.
* Added theming support. Requires Windows XP or later.
* Configuration is read from WIN.INI under W32S/Win9x/Me and from the registry for all NT platforms.
* Removed safe DS_SHELLFONT declaration.

1.11 (20090404)
=======================
* Updated translations (thanks to the friends at ReactOS' community).
* Added DS_SHELLFONT to some dialogs into various translations (sometimes it was specified, sometimes it was not).
* Added support for newer conversion units.
* Fixed mistake into english translation (lenghts -> lengths).
* Now decimal and thousand separators can be also read directly from registry (NT only, not 9x/ME).
* Fixed bug when pressing an operator twice (like '1++2=' caused error).
* Now unary operators and constant generators won't break RPN queue.

1.10 (20080813)
=======================
* Added Norvegian and Korean translations.
* Fixed Polish and Slovak translations.
* Fixed percent mode.
* Fixed some unsignaled overflow errors.
* Fixed conversion method, now scientific notation is recognized too.
* Added compilation for UNICODE executables.
* Plain MINGW toolchain does not support wWinMain function, so I switched to old WinMain if it is not under ReactOS' build tree.
* Detect error if UNICODE version is launched into Win9x (avoid the lock).

1.09 (20080630)
=======================
* Fixed bug with Conversion function: "Category" type must be found like "from" and "to" because the combobox sorts its items alphabetically.
* Fixed bug with memory function and GNU multi-precision libraries: the memory must be initialized to zero when the calculator starts, otherwise "MP" will crash.
* Fixed bug when closing an expression with right parentheses.

1.08 (20080520)
=======================
* Added macro DISABLE_HTMLHELP_SUPPORT for disabling the compilation of htmlhelp support.
* Added RSH operator.
* It is possible to change the numeric base (hex/oct/bin/dec) during a calculation.
* Conversion layout has been implemented (HTML Help documentation is fixed too).
* Corrected precision underflow/overflow when working with trigonometric functions.
* cbrt() function is not used if compiling into ReactOS build system.
* Resources are moved into /res directory.
* Added new (partial) support for other languages: bulgarian, spanish, german, dutch, polish, russian, slovak, ukrainian.
* Decimal precision of number with standard layout has been limited to 16 digits because the output display is smaller here (GMP version only).
* Fixed buffer overflow with function update_lcd_display().
* The decimal point is now preserved when switching to temporary scientific notation.
* The content of the output display is now cleared before doing a paste from clipboard.
* The position of the calculator on the screen is kept when switching between various working layouts (standard/conversion/scientific).

1.07 (20071219)
=======================
* Added support for GNU multi-precision libraries. LibGMP and LibMPFR are required for compiling ReactOS Calc with big number support.
* When calculating the standard deviation, the population can be 'n' or 'n-1' as the true Microsoft Calculator does.
* Unified language support: just one executable for all.
* Fixed type bug into CopyMemToClipboard() when compiled with WideChar support.
* The code for handling the memory functions has been simplified and now it calls directly the RPN engine.
* Fixed bug into statistical window, when uploading numbers with different bases.
* Fixed bug into integer limitation: now if the selection changes on QWORD, DWORD, WORD or BYTE, then the result is modified immediately.
* Fixed bug signaled by remi-aldo about a the precision issue.
* Fixed bug into shortcuts from keyboard: modulo shortcut was missing.
* Implemented coloured buttons.
* ReactOS Calc has been compiled for working with x86-64 (still untested on the real hardware).

1.06 (20070518)
=======================
* The decimal separator is copied into the clipboard, but only if it has been typed by the user.
* Now the [+/-] button can change the sign of any number into the output display.
* Added italian translation of the help file.

1.05 (20070503)
=======================
* Fixed bug when the following input keys are pressed: [0] [.] [+/-] and another number, then the dot and the sign were lost.
* The ERROR message at division by zero is displayed again.
* [Exp] button won't work if the output display is zero (0e+100 is always zero).
* Now [.] can start a number directly: if it is pressed when display is empty then "0." is pushed automatically.

1.04 (20070430)
=======================
* Fixed a bug when zero is the first number entered.
* The change of the sign +/- doesn't work if the display is empty or zero.
* Added logical operators into decimal mode (obviously, only the integer part is processed).
* Fixed decimal precision to highest possible resolution.
* Decimal point and thousand separator are now regional dependant.
* Added memory subtraction and memory swap commands.
* Added 2*PI constant (generated by "inv"+"pi").
* Added Help popups for calculator functions.
* Added User's manual and Help file support.
* Now the PASTE menu command is disabled if the clipboard doesn't store good data.
* Fixed bug with BACK button.
* Fixed ":q" command from clipboard to the 'cancel' button.

1.03 (20070404)
=======================
* Added double-click check on statistic window.
* Fixed focus selection when switching from statistic window with RET button.
* EQUAL button will now reduce a number entered with exponential notation (if it's possible).
* Version number was not updated to 1.02 in previous version.

1.02 (20070402)
=======================
* Fixed a "copy-paste" error into hyperbolic functions.
* Now context menu is enabled only when child controls are clicked.

1.01 (20070331)
=======================
* Fixed english translation for "Radians" and "Gradians".
* Corrected conversion between radians and gradians angles.
* Added work-around for catching keys without the keyboard hook (selectable at compile time).
* The version number of the programme has been moved from the resource files to ABOUT.C.
* "DOT" function can be used for starting a number (integer part will be zero).
* Added repeat function.
* If the number is greater than maximum resolution, it will be displayed with exponential notation.
* Removed mouse and keyboard focuses from displayed buttons.
* Added normal and small icons.

1.00 (20070323)
=======================
* First write.
