 * \brief      Perform a Blowfish-CTR buffer encryption/decryption operation.
 *
 * \warning    You must never reuse a nonce value with the same key. Doing so
 *             would void the encryption for the two messages encrypted with
 *             the same nonce and key.
 *
 *             There are two common strategies for managing nonces with CTR:
 *
 *             1. You can handle everything as a single message processed over
 *             successive calls to this function. In that case, you want to
 *             set \p nonce_counter and \p nc_off to 0 for the first call, and
 *             then preserve the values of \p nonce_counter, \p nc_off and \p
 *             stream_block across calls to this function as they will be
 *             updated by this function.
 *
 *             With this strategy, you must not encrypt more than 2**64
 *             blocks of data with the same key.
 *
 *             2. You can encrypt separate messages by dividing the \p
 *             nonce_counter buffer in two areas: the first one used for a
 *             per-message nonce, handled by yourself, and the second one
 *             updated by this function internally.
 *
 *             For example, you might reserve the first 4 bytes for the
 *             per-message nonce, and the last 4 bytes for internal use. In that
 *             case, before calling this function on a new message you need to
 *             set the first 4 bytes of \p nonce_counter to your chosen nonce
 *             value, the last 4 to 0, and \p nc_off to 0 (which will cause \p
 *             stream_block to be ignored). That way, you can encrypt at most
 *             2**32 messages of up to 2**32 blocks each with the same key.
 *
 *             The per-message nonce (or information sufficient to reconstruct
 *             it) needs to be communicated with the ciphertext and must be unique.
 *             The recommended way to ensure uniqueness is to use a message
 *             counter.
 *
 *             Note that for both stategies, sizes are measured in blocks and
 *             that a Blowfish block is 8 bytes.
 *
 * \warning    Upon return, \p stream_block contains sensitive data. Its
 *             content must not be written to insecure storage and should be
 *             securely discarded as soon as it's no longer needed.
 *
 * \param ctx           The Blowfish context to use. This must be initialized
 *                      and bound to a key.
 * \param length        The length of the input data in Bytes.
 * \param nc_off        The offset in the current stream_block (for resuming
 *                      within current cipher stream). The offset pointer
 *                      should be \c 0 at the start of a stream and must be
 *                      smaller than \c 8. It is updated by this function.
 * \param nonce_counter The 64-bit nonce and counter. This must point to a
 *                      read/write buffer of length \c 8 Bytes.
 * \param stream_block  The saved stream-block for resuming. This must point to
 *                      a read/write buffer of length \c 8 Bytes.
 * \param input         The input data. This must be a readable buffer of
 *                      length \p length Bytes.
 * \param output        The output data. This must be a writable buffer of
 *                      length \p length Bytes.
 *
 * \return              \c 0 if successful.
