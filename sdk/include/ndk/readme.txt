2. ORIGINS OF NDK MATERIAL, AND ADDING YOUR OWN

2.1 CONTRIBUTIONS AND SOURCES

The NDK could not exist without the various contributions made by a variety of people
and sources. The following public sources of information were lawfully used:

- GNU NTIFS.H, Revision 43
- W32API, Version 2.5
- Microsoft Windows Driver Kit
- Microsoft Driver Development Kit 2003 SP1
- Microsoft Driver Development Kit 2000
- Microsoft Driver Development Kit NT 4
- Microsoft Driver Development Kit WinME
- Microsoft Installable File Systems Kit 2003 SP1
- Microsoft Windows Debugger (WinDBG) 6.5.0003.7

- Windows NT/2000 Native API Reference
- Windows NT File System Internals
- Windows Internals I - II
- Windows Internals 4th Edition

If the information contained in these sources was copyrighted, the information was not
copied, but simply used as a basis for developing a compatible and identical definition.
No information protected by a patent or NDA was used. All information was publically
located through the Internet or purchased or licensed for lawful use.

Additionally, the following people contributed to the NDK:

- Art Yerkes
- Eric Kohl
- Filip Navara
- Steven Edwards
- Matthieu Suiche
- Stefan Ginsberg
- Timo Kreuzer

2.2 BECOMING A CONTRIBUTOR

To contribute information to the NDK, simply contact the author with your new structure,
definition, enumeration, or prototype. Please make sure that your addition is:

1) Actually correct!
2) Present in Windows NT 5, 5.1, 5.2, 6.0, 6.1 and/or 6.2
3) Not already accessible through another public header in the DDK, IFS, WDK and/or PSDK.
4) From a publically verifiable source. The author needs to be able to search for your
   addition in a public information location (book, Internet, etc) and locate this definition.
5) Not Reversed. Reversing a type is STRONGLY discouraged and a reversed type will more then likely
   not be accepted, due to the fact that functionality and naming will be entirely guessed, and things
   like unions are almost impossible to determine. It can also bring up possible legal ramifications
   depending on your location. However, using a tool to dump the strings inside an executable
   for the purpose of locating the actual name or definition of a structure (sometimes possible due
   to ASSERTs or debugging strings) is considered 'fair use' and will be a likely candidate.

If your contribution satsfies these points, then please submit it to the author with the following
statement:

"
Copyright Grant.
I grant to you a perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright), worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, copyright license, without any obligation for accounting to me, to reproduce,
prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, distribute, and implement
my Contribution to the full extent of my copyright interest in the Contribution.
"

If you wish to be credited for your contribution (which the author is more than happy to do!), you
should add:

"As a condition of the copyright grant, you must include an attribution in any derivative work you make
based on the Contribution. That attribution must include, at minimum, my name."

This will allow you to have your name in the readme.txt file (which you are now reading). If you wish to
remain anonymous, simply do not include this statement.

3. USAGE

3.1 ORGANIZATION

   * The NDK is organized in a main folder (include/ndk) with arch-specific subfolders (ex: include/ndk/i386). 
   * The NDK is structured by NT Subsystem Component (ex: ex, ps, rtl, etc). 
   * The NDK can either be included on-demand (#include <ndk/xxxxx.h>) or globally (#include <ndk/ntndk.h>).
     The former is recommended to reduce compile time. 
   * The NDK is structured by function and type. Every Subsystem Component has an associated "xxfuncs.h" and
    "xxtypes.h" header, where "xx" is the Subsystem (ex: iofuncs.h, iotypes.h) 
   * The NDK has a special file called "umtypes.h" which exports to User-Mode or Native-Mode Applications the
     basic NT types which are present in ntdef.h. This file cannot be included since it would conflict with
     winnt.h and/or windef.h. Thus, umtypes.h provides the missing types. This file is automatically included
     in a User-Mode NDK project. 
   * The NDK also includes a file called "umfuncs.h" which exports to User-Mode or Native-Mode Applications
     undocumented functions which can only be accessed from ntdll.dll. 
   * The NDK has another special file called "ifssupp.h", which exports to Kernel-Mode drivers a few types which
     are only documented in the IFS kit, and are part of some native definitions. It will be deprecated next year
     with the release of the WDK. 

3.2 USING IN YOUR PROJECT

    *  User Mode Application requiring Native Types: 

       #define WIN32_NO_STATUS   /* Tell Windows headers you'll use ntstatus.h from PSDK */
       #include "windows.h"      /* Declare Windows Headers like you normally would */
       #include "ntndk.h"        /* Declare the NDK Headers */

    * Native Mode Application: 

       #include "windows.h"      /* Declare Windows Headers for basic types. NEEDED UNTIL NDK 1.5 */
       #include "ntndk.h"        /* Declare the NDK Headers */

    * Kernel Mode Driver: 

       #include "ntddk.h"       /* Declare DDK Headers like you normally would */
       #include "ntndk.h"       /* Declare the NDK Headers */

    * You may also include only the files you need (example for User-Mode application):

       #define WIN32_NO_STATUS   /* Tell Windows headers you'll use ntstatus.h from PSDK */
       #include "windows.h"      /* Declare Windows Headers like you normally would */
       #include "rtlfuncs.h"     /* Declare the Rtl* Functions */

3.3 CAVEATS

    * winternl.h: This header, part of the PSDK, was released by Microsoft as part of one of the governmen
      lawsuits against it, and documents a certain (minimal) part of the Native API and/or types. Unfortunately,
      Microsoft decided to hack the Native Types and to define them incorrectly, replacing real members by "reserved"
      ones. As such, you 'cannot include winternl.h in any project that uses the NDK. Note however, that the NDK fully
      replaces it and retains compatibility with any project that used it.
    * Native programs: Native programs must include "windows.h" until the next release of the NDK (1.5). The upcoming
      version will automatically detect the lack of missing types and include them. Note however that you will still
      need to have the PSDK installed.
