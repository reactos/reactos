ReactOS Build System Documentation
==================================

Building ReactOS
----------------
To generate GNU make makefiles and building ReactOS do the following:

	1) Go to the top-level reactos directory
	2) Run the command: mingw32-make

This will start building ReactOS.

To build a bootable CD run the following command:

	mingw32-make bootcd

This will create ReactOS.iso in the top-level reactos directory.


Top-level XML Build File
------------------------
The top-level xml build file (ReactOS.rbuild) is processed by rbuild. The following is an example of how it could look like:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE project SYSTEM "tools/rbuild/project.dtd">
<project name="ReactOS" makefile="Makefile.auto" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
	<xi:include href="config.rbuild">
		<xi:fallback>
			<xi:include href="config.template.rbuild" />
		</xi:fallback>
	</xi:include>

	<define name="_M_IX86" />
	<if property="DBG" value="1">
		<define name="DBG" value="1" />
		<property name="DBG_OR_KDBG" value="true" />
	</if>

	<include base="ReactOS">include</include>

	<directory name="boot">
		<xi:include href="boot/boot.rbuild" />
	</directory>

	<module name="bootcd" type="iso">
	</module>
</project>


xi:include
----------
It is possible to split an xml build file over several files. The include element in the xi namespace is used to accomplish this.

Syntax:
	<xi:include href="config.rbuild">
		<xi:fallback>
			<xi:include href="config.template.rbuild" />
		</xi:fallback>
	</xi:include>

Attributes:
	href - Name of xml build file to include. The filename is relative to the location of the current xml build file.

Value:
	None.

Elements:
	xi:fallback


xi:fallback
-----------
This element is used to provide the name of an alternate file that is to be included if the first include file did not exists.

Attributes:
	None.

Value:
	None.

Elements:
	xi:include.


Project element
---------------
There can be one project per top-level XML build file. A project can only be defined in a top-level xml build file.
