    // This is called to tell the thread to exit.
    //
    // This may be called from any context since it
    // only signals the thread to exit, and does not
    // wait for it. It is safe to release the object
    // reference when this routine returns.
    //
    // This routine requires an FxSystemThread* to perform
    // final thread reaping. This allows a driver to ensure that
    // child threads have exited by waiting on their object pointer,
    // before exiting a top level driver thread.
    //
    // This is required since a frameworks object that contains a
    // system thread can be dereferenced, and thus destroyed
    // in any context, so waiting may not be available. But unless
    // a wait is done on the thread object pointer, no guarantee can be
    // made that the thread has actually run and exited before
    // the drivers code get unloaded, resulting in a system crash.
    //
    // Top level threads, such as the reaper, are exited using the
    // ExitThread() synchronous call that waits for it to exit. This
    // can be done in synchronous thread context such as DriverUnload
    // time.
    //
    // If Synchronous threading is configured in the frameworks, the
    // FxDriver object always contains a top level worker thread that
    // may be used as the reaper, and DriverUnload synchronously waits
    // for this thread to finish processing its work queue before
    // exiting.
    //
    // A worker thread will not exit unless it has processed
    // all of its queued work items. If processing of queued
    // workitems is no longer desired, then use CancelWorkItem
    // to remove the items before calling this method.
