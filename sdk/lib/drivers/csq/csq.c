 * ReactOS Cancel-Safe Queue library
 * Copyright (c) 2004, Vizzini (vizzini@plasmic.com)
 * Licensed under the GNU GPL for the ReactOS project
 *
 * This file implements the ReactOS CSQ library.  For background and overview
 * information on these routines, read csq.h.   For the authoritative reference
 * to using these routines, see the current DDK (IoCsqXXX and CsqXxx callbacks).
 *
 * There are a couple of subtle races that this library is designed to avoid.
 * Please read the code (particularly IoCsqInsertIrpEx and IoCsqRemoveIrp) for
 * some details.
 *
 * In general, we try here to avoid the race between these queue/dequeue
 * interfaces and our own cancel routine.  This library supplies a cancel
 * routine that is used in all IRPs that are queued to it.  The major race
 * conditions surround the proper handling of in-between cases, such as in-progress
 * queue and de-queue operations.
 *
 * When you're thinking about these operations, keep in mind that three or four
 * processors can have queue and dequeue operations in progress simultaneously,
 * and a user thread may cancel any IRP at any time.  Also, these operations don't
 * all happen at DISPATCH_LEVEL all of the time, so thread switching on a single
 * processor can create races too.

         * *before* you queue the IRP, our cancel routine will get called back for
         * an IRP that isn't in its queue.
         *
         * There are three possibilities:
         * 1) We get an IRP, we queue it, and it is valid the whole way
         * 2) We get an IRP, and the IO manager cancels it before we're done here
         * 3) We get an IRP, queue it, and the IO manager cancels it.
         *
         * #2 is is a booger.
         *
         * When the IO manger receives a request to cancel an IRP, it sets the cancel
         * bit in the IRP's control byte to TRUE.  Then, it looks to see if a cancel
         * routine is set.  If it isn't, the IO manager just returns to the caller.
         * If there *is* a routine, it gets called.
         *
         * If we test for cancel first and then set the cancel routine, there is a spot
         * between test and set that the IO manager can cancel us without our knowledge,
         * so we miss a cancel request.  That is bad.
         *
         * If we set a routine first and then test for cancel, we race with our completion
         * routine:  We set the routine, the IO Manager sets cancel, we test cancel and find
         * it is TRUE.  Meanwhile the IO manager has called our cancel routine already, so
         * we can't complete the IRP because it'll rip it out from under the cancel routine.
         *
         * The IO manager does us a favor though: it nulls out the cancel routine in the IRP
         * before calling it.  Therefore, if we test to see if the cancel routine is NULL
         * (after we have just set it), that means our own cancel routine is already working
         * on the IRP, and we can just return quietly.  Otherwise, we have to de-queue the
         * IRP and cancel it ourselves.
         *
         * We have to go through all of this mess because this API guarantees that we will
         * never return having left a canceled IRP in the queue.
