.SH NAME
ldns-read-zone \- read a zonefile and print it
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ldns-read-zone 
.IR ZONEFILE 

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBldns-read-zone\fR reads a DNS zone file and prints it. The output has 1
resource record per line, and no pretty-printing makeup.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-0\fR
Print a (null) for the RRSIG inception, expiry and key data. This option
can be used when comparing different signing systems that use the same
DNSKEYs for signing but would have a slightly different timings/jitter.

.TP
\fB-b\fR
Include Bubble Babble encoding of DS's.

.TP
\fB-c\fR
Canonicalize all resource records in the zone before printing

.TP
\fB-d\fR
Only print DNSSEC data from the zone. This option skips every record
that is not of type NSEC, NSEC3 or RRSIG. DNSKEY and DS records are not
printed.

.TP
\fB-e\fR \fIRR type\fR
Do not print RRs of the given \fIrr type\fR.
This option may be given multiple times.
\fB-e\fR is not meant to be used together with \fB-E\fR.

.TP
\fB-E\fR \fIRR type\fR
Print only RRs of the given \fIrr type\fR.
This option may be given multiple times.
\fB-E\fR is not meant to be used together with \fB-e\fR.

.TP
\fB-h\fR
Show usage and exit

.TP
\fB-n\fR
Do not print the SOA record

.TP
\fB-p\fR
Pad the SOA serial number with spaces so the number and the spaces together
take ten characters. This is useful for in file serial number increments.

.TP
\fB-s\fR
Strip DNSSEC data from the zone. This option skips every record
that is of type NSEC, NSEC3 or RRSIG. DNSKEY and DS records are still
printed.

.TP
\fB-S\fR \fI[[+|0]number | YYYYMMDDxx | unixtime ]\fR
Set serial number to the given \fInumber\fR, or when preceded by a sign,
offset the existing number with it. When giving the literal strings
\fIYYYYMMDDxx\fR or \fIunixtime\fR, the serial number is tried to be reset
in datecounter or in unixtime format respectively. Though is the updated serial
number is smaller than the original one, the original one is simply
increased by one.

When updating a serial number, records of type NSEC, NSEC3, RRSIG and DNSKEY
will be skipped when printing the zone.

.TP
\fB-u\fR \fIRR type\fR
Mark \fIRR type\fR for printing in unknown type format.

\fB-u\fR is not meant to be used together with \fB-U\fR.

.TP
\fB-U\fR \fIRR type\fR
Mark \fIRR type\fR for \fBnot\fR printing in unknown type format.

The first occurrence of the \fB-U\fR option marks all RR types for printing
in unknown type format except for the given \fIRR type\fR.
Subsequent \fB-U\fR options will clear the mark for those \fIRR type\fRs too,
so that only the given \fIRR type\fRs will be printed in the presentation 
format specific for those \fIRR type\fRs.

\fB-U\fR is not meant to be used together with \fB-u\fR.

.TP
\fB-v\fR
Show the version and exit

.TP
\fB-z\fR
Sort the zone before printing (this implies \-c)
