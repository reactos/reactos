.SH DESCRIPTION

In the first form: 
A TLS connection to \fIname\fR:\fIport\fR is established.
The TLSA resource record(s) for \fIname\fR are used to authenticate
the connection.

In the second form:
The TLSA record(s) are read from \fItlsafile\fR and used to authenticate
the TLS service they reference.

In the third form:
A TLS connection to \fIname\fR:\fIport\fR is established and used to
create the TLSA resource record(s) that would authenticate the connection.
The parameters for TLSA rr creation are:

.PD 0
.I Certificate-usage\fR:
.RS
.IP "0 | PKIX-TA"
CA constraint
.IP "1 | PKIX-EE"
Service certificate constraint
.IP "2 | DANE-TA"
Trust anchor assertion
.IP "3 | DANE-EE"
Domain-issued certificate (default)
.RE

.I Selector\fR:
.RS
.IP "0 | Cert"
Full certificate
.IP "1 | SPKI"
SubjectPublicKeyInfo (default)
.RE

.I Matching-type\fR:
.RS
.IP "0 | Full"
No hash used
.IP "1 | SHA2-256"
SHA-256 (default)
.IP "2 | SHA2-512"
SHA-512

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -4
TLS connect IPv4 only
.IP -6
TLS connect IPv6 only
.IP "-a \fIaddress\fR"
Don't try to resolve \fIname\fR, but connect to \fIaddress\fR instead.

This option may be given more than once.
.IP -b
print "\fIname\fR\. TYPE52 \\# \fIsize\fR \fIhexdata\fR" form instead
of TLSA presentation format.
.IP "-c \fIcertfile\fR"
Do not TLS connect to \fIname\fR:\fIport\fR, but authenticate (or make
TLSA records) for the certificate (chain) in \fIcertfile\fR instead.
.IP -d
Assume DNSSEC validity even when the TLSA records were acquired insecure
or were bogus.
.IP "-f \fICAfile\fR"
Use CAfile to validate. @DEFAULT_CAFILE@
.IP -h
Print short usage help
.IP -i
Interact after connecting.
.IP "-k \fIkeyfile\fR"
Specify a file that contains a trusted DNSKEY or DS rr.
Key(s) are used when chasing signatures (i.e. \fI-S\fR is given).

This option may be given more than once.

Alternatively, if \fB-k\fR is not specified, and a default trust anchor
(@LDNS_TRUST_ANCHOR_FILE@) exists and contains a valid DNSKEY or DS record,
it will be used as the trust anchor.
.IP -n
Do \fBnot\fR verify server name in certificate.
.IP "-o \fIoffset\fR"
When creating a "Trust anchor assertion" TLSA resource record,
select the \fIoffset\fRth certificate offset from the end
of the validation chain. 0 means the last certificate, 1 the one but last,
2 the second but last, etc.

When \fIoffset\fR is \-1 (the default), the last certificate
is used (like with 0) that MUST be self-signed. This can help to make
sure that the intended (self signed) trust anchor is actually present
in the server certificate chain (which is a DANE requirement).
.IP "-p \fICApath\fR"
Use certificates in the \fICApath\fR directory to validate. @DEFAULT_CAPATH@
.IP -s
When creating TLSA resource records with the "CA Constraint" and the
"Service Certificate Constraint" certificate usage, do not validate and
assume PKIX is valid.

For "CA Constraint" this means that verification should end with a
self-signed certificate.
.IP -S
Chase signature(s) to a known key.

Without this option, the local network is trusted to provide
a DNSSEC resolver (i.e. AD bit is checked).
.IP "-t \fItlsafile\fR"
Read TLSA record(s) from \fItlsafile\fR. When \fIname\fR and \fIport\fR
are also given, only TLSA records that match the \fIname\fR, \fIport\fR and
\fItransport\fR are used. Otherwise the owner name of the TLSA record(s)
will be used to determine \fIname\fR, \fIport\fR and \fItransport\fR.
.IP -T
Return exit status 2 for PKIX validated connections without (secure)
TLSA records(s)
.IP -u
Use UDP transport instead of TCP.
.IP -v
Show version and exit.

.SH "FILES"
.TP
@LDNS_TRUST_ANCHOR_FILE@
The file from which trusted keys are loaded for signature chasing,
when no \fB-k\fR option is given.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.LP
