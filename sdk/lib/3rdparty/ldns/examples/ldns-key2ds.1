.B ldns-key2ds 
.IR file

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBldns-key2ds\fR is used to transform a public DNSKEY RR to a DS RR.
When run it will read \fIfile\fR with a DNSKEY RR in it and
it will create a .ds file with the DS RR in it.

It prints out the basename for this file (K<name>+<alg>+<id>).

By default it takes a pick of algorithm similar to the key algorithm,
SHA1 for RSASHA1, and so on.
