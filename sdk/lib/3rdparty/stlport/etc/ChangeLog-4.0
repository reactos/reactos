The following fix was made in 4.0 since 4.0 Release Candidate :

	* _threads.h/_config.h : for all platforms, static mutexes made non-indirect

	* _iterator_base.h : made possible to choose between iterator_traits approach
	  and old-style iterator queries like iterator_category(), value_type(), etc. 
	  (Thanks to John R. Bandela for pointing this out)
	* _config.h, stl_user_config.h : introduced __STL_OLD_HP_ITERATOR_QUERIES switch to
	  allow old-style and new-style iterator queries (for all compilers). 
	  iterator_traits<> made always defined. 

	* _ptr_specialize.h - specializations of type_traits<> for compilers w/o partial spec
	  moved into separate file. Added iterator_traits<> specializations for pointer types
	  for __STL_NO_OLD_HP_ITERATOR_QUERIES case. Macro __STL_POINTERS_SPECIALIZE is now available
	  to specialize both type_traits and iterator_traits for a pointer to user-defined 
	  type (latter for standard-style iterator queries mode only)

	* vc5.mak : __STL_NO_FORCE_INSTANTIATE flag restored

	* _site_config.h : if __STL_NO_NEW_IOSTREAMS or __STL_NO_IOSTREAMS specified, 
	 SGI iostreams are being turned off. __STL_NO_SGI_IOSTREAMS moved into stl_user_config.h
	(Thanks to Sathish T C for the report)

	  constraints and to allow for more compact symbols. 
	  "stlport::" namespace is still defined for backwards compatibility.

	* iostreams library now compiles on HP with aCC (thanks to Steven Serocki for the patch).

	* Configuration for SUN Workshop 6.0 EA provided.
	
	* For VC++, corresponding [selected by /MT(d) or /MD(d) switch]
	  STLport iostreams library is being linked automatically - all you
	  need is to put library in lib search path or specify additional library path.

	* Ability to turn on all warnings in your own code if you're using 
	  a compiler with appropriate support (e.g. MSVC6).
	  
	* Small fixes posted to the forum integrated:
	
	 * config/stl_wince.h : added __STL_HAS_NO_NEW_C_HEADERS switch
	 * wrap_std/strsream  : fixed preprocessor bug, strstream.h included
	  when not using new-style headers
	 * other fixes
	
The following changes were made in 3.2.2 beta 4 since 3.2.2 Beta 3:

	* Merged changes made to SGI standard library snapshot on 01/10.

	* Major restructuring of header files - for maintainability and
	  8.3 filesystems benefit.

	* Major debug mode improvements - new debug mode now works with
	 VC++, gcc, intel, SUNpro, MetroWerks.

	* Regression test suite changed to new-style headers - thanks to
	  Dima Pasechnik for the initial port.
	
	* <rope> fixes for Watcom

	* many miscellanous fixes.
	
The following changes were made in 3.2.2 beta 3 since 3.2.2 Beta 2:

	* Merged changes made to SGI standard library snapshot in December.
	
	* std:: is not used for STLport namespace even with SGI iostreams,
	  to avoid possible clashes and facilitate 3rd-party library use.
          Same macro redefinition technique for stlport:: used to keep clients
	  code with literal std:: happy as in native iostreams mode.
	
	* C library headers wrapping changed to allow multiple inclusion tricks
	  (needed by gcc-2.95 mostly)
	
	* gcc-2.95 and CodeWarrior configurations updated.

	* HP aCC fixes applied.

	* Visual C++ - added static library targets, build refined.
	  Fixed memory-mapping bugs.
	
	* auto_ptr updated, now it passes polymorphic tests with VC++.

	* Many small bugfixes.
	
The following changes were made in 3.2.2 beta 2 since 3.2.2 Beta 1:

	* Fixed SUN CC deque<> problem with -g
	
	* Added configuration and makefiles for DEC VMS, Borland and Win32 gcc.

	* Merged changes made to November SGI standard library snapshot.

	* config changes - "configure" made obsolete and moved into "stlport/config/new_compiler".

	* __STL_TYPENAME_ON_RETURN_TYPE handling changed.
	
	* Miscellanous fixes.

The following changes were made in 3.2.2 Beta 1 since 3.2.1 release:

	* SGI iostreams adopted. To use SGI iostreams, user have to set
	  __SGI_STL_OWN_IOSTREAMS flag and to build the library in "src"
	  directory to link with. Please read INSTALL file for detailed
	  instructions.
	  Default setting is NOT to use SGI iostreams (wrappers used as before).

	* Debug mode completely redesigned - debug mode containers are 
	  implemented in terms of wrappers around non-debug ones.
	  That provides for more clean and efficient implementation and
	  binary compatibility between debug and non-debug versions.

	* Additional configurations added for platforms :
	     - gcc-2.95
	     - SUNpro CC 5.0 in "compatibility" mode
	  "configure" made obsolete.
	
	* Bugfixes reported by users since 3.2.1 release merged 

The following changes were made in 3.2.1 since 3.2 release:

	* Now, by default, STLPort renames std:: namespace for user
	  if __STL_USE_OWN_NAMESPACE is used. To make it possible, many new
	  wrapper headers introduced. Internally, STLport uses stlport:: namespace,
	  so no link- or run- time clashes are possible, and you don't have to rebuild
	  the runtime lib (which you don't want to).
	  This feature makes STLport usable out-of-the box, without any modifications
	  for client code, with any compiler.

	* Code bloat reduction : hashtable<T> uses vector<void*> internally.

	* Vector : efficiency/code bloat reduction fixes.

	* Visual C++ : DLL export is supported for allocators and strings. To use it, 
	  please define __STL_USE_DECLSPEC in all modules and __STL_DESIGNATED_DLL
	  for the DLL which is supposed to instantiate STLport exports (at least one
	  source of this DLL must include <string>.

        * Visual C++ : for MT synchronization, <windows.h> is not included anymore.
	
	* For Sunpro C++ 5.0 : all headers are linked into stlport/SC5, so only
	  one include path is needed. Note that SC5.0 has problems with relative 
	  search path. It is easy to work around : in your makefiles, instead of
	  "STL_INCL=../.." , write "STL_INCL=${PWD}/../..".

	* Configuration files provided for compilers : 
	   KAI C++
	   DEC C++ (6.x, 5.x)
	   Borland 5.02 is back on the road (finally !)
	  
	* Windows CE config provided for Visual C++.

	* __STL_NO_IOSTREAMS switch introduced for embedded platforms.
	
	* Lots of minor config fixes and improvements for various platforms.
