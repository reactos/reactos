 *
 * @param[in,out] RegistryHive
 * A pointer to a hive descriptor to be initialized.
 *
 * @param[in] OperationType
 * The operation type to choose for hive initialization.
 * For further information about this, see Remarks.
 *
 * @param[in] HiveFlags
 * A hive flag. Such flag is used to determine what kind
 * of action must be taken into the hive or what aspects
 * must be taken into account for such hive. For further
 * information, see Remarks.
 *
 * @param[in] FileType
 * Hive file type. For the newly initialized hive, you can
 * choose from three different types for the hive:
 *
 * HFILE_TYPE_PRIMARY - Initializes a hive as primary hive
 * of the system.
 *
 * HFILE_TYPE_LOG - The newly created hive is a hive log.
 * Logs don't exist per se but they're accompanied with their
 * associated primary hives. The Log field member of the hive
 * descriptor is set to TRUE.
 *
 * HFILE_TYPE_EXTERNAL - The newly created hive is a portable
 * hive, that can be used and copied for different machines,
 * unlike primary hives.
 *
 * HFILE_TYPE_ALTERNATE - The newly created hive is an alternate hive.
 * Technically speaking it is the same as a primary hive (the representation
 * of on-disk image of the registry header is HFILE_TYPE_PRIMARY), with
 * the purpose is to serve as a backup hive. The Alternate field of the
 * hive descriptor is set to TRUE. Only the SYSTEM hive has a backup
 * alternate hive.
 *
 * @param[in] HiveData
 * An arbitrary pointer that points to the hive data. Usually this
 * data is in form of a hive base block given by the caller of this
 * function.
 *
 * @param[in] Allocate
 * A pointer to a ALLOCATE_ROUTINE function that describes
 * the main allocation routine for this hive. This parameter
 * can be NULL.
 *
 * @param[in] Free
 * A pointer to a FREE_ROUTINE function that describes the
 * the main memory freeing routine for this hive. This parameter
 * can be NULL.
 *
 * @param[in] FileSetSize
 * A pointer to a FILE_SET_SIZE_ROUTINE function that describes
 * the file set size routine for this hive. This parameter
 * can be NULL.
 *
 * @param[in] FileWrite
 * A pointer to a FILE_WRITE_ROUTINE function that describes
 * the file writing routine for this hive. This parameter
 * can be NULL.
 *
 * @param[in] FileRead
 * A pointer to a FILE_READ_ROUTINE function that describes
 * the file reading routine for this hive. This parameter
 * can be NULL.
 *
 * @param[in] FileFlush
 * A pointer to a FILE_FLUSH_ROUTINE function that describes
 * the file flushing routine for this hive. This parameter
 * can be NULL.
 *
 * @param[in] Cluster
 * The registry hive cluster to be set. Usually this value
 * is set to 1.
 *
 * @param[in] FileName
 * A to a NULL-terminated Unicode string structure containing
 * the hive file name. This parameter can be NULL.
 *
 * @return
 * Returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the function has successfully
 * initialized the hive. STATUS_REGISTRY_RECOVERED is returned
 * if the hive has subdued previous damage and it's been recovered.
 * This function will perform a hive writing and flushing with
 * healthy and recovered data in that case. STATUS_REGISTRY_IO_FAILED
 * is returned if registry hive writing/flushing of recovered data
 * has failed. STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER is returned if an invalid
 * operation type pointed by OperationType parameter has been
 * submitted. A failure NTSTATUS code is returned otherwise.
 *
 * @remarks
 * OperationType parameter influences how should the hive be
 * initialized. These are the following supported operation
 * types:
 *
 * HINIT_CREATE -- Creates a new fresh hive.
 *
 * HINIT_MEMORY -- Initializes a registry hive that already exists
 *                 from memory. The hive data is copied from the
 *                 loaded hive in memory and used for read/write
 *                 access.
 *
 * HINIT_FLAT -- Initializes a flat registry hive, with data that can
 *               only be read and not written into. Cells are always
 *               allocated on a flat hive.
 *
 * HINIT_FILE -- Initializes a hive from a hive file from the physical
 *               backing storage of the system. In this situation the
 *               function will perform self-healing and resuscitation
 *               procedures if data read from the physical hive file
 *               is corrupt.
 *
 * HINIT_MEMORY_INPLACE -- This operation type is similar to HINIT_FLAT,
 *                         with the difference is that the hive is initialized
 *                         with hive data from memory. The hive can only be read
 *                         and not written into.
 *
 * HINIT_MAPFILE -- Initializes a hive from a hive file from the physical
 *                  backing storage of the system. Unlike HINIT_FILE, the
 *                  initialized hive is not backed to paged pool in memory
 *                  but rather through mapping views.
 *
 * Alongside the operation type, the hive flags also influence the aspect
 * of the newly initialized hive. These are the following supported hive
 * flags:
 *
 * HIVE_VOLATILE -- Tells the function that this hive will be volatile, that
 *                  is, the data stored inside the hive space resides only
 *                  in volatile memory of the system, aka the RAM, and the
 *                  data will be erased upon shutdown of the system.
 *
 * HIVE_NOLAZYFLUSH -- Tells the function that no lazy flushing must be
 *                     done to this hive.
