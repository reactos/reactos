 * hypot() function for DJGPP.
 *
 * hypot() computes sqrt(x^2 + y^2).  The problem with the obvious
 * naive implementation is that it might fail for very large or
 * very small arguments.  For instance, for large x or y the result
 * might overflow even if the value of the function should not,
 * because squaring a large number might trigger an overflow.  For
 * very small numbers, their square might underflow and will be
 * silently replaced by zero; this won't cause an exception, but might
 * have an adverse effect on the accuracy of the result.
 *
 * This implementation tries to avoid the above pitfals, without
 * inflicting too much of a performance hit.
