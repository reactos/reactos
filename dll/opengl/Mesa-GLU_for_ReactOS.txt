Here is a brief explanation on how to synchronize Mesa/GLU in ReactOS.

Current included Mesa/GLU version is 9.0.0.


0) Mesa/GLU:


0-1)  Mesa/GLU repository:

https://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/glu/


0-2) Inclusion in ReactOS code:

Mesa/GLU 9.0.0 code was added in
reactos/dll/opengl/glu32/
by
https://svn.reactos.org/svn/reactos?view=revision&revision=57621 (jgardou)


1) Checking ReactOS included code against Mesa/GLU upstream code:


1-1) Checking Mesa/GLU upstream feeds themselves:

Diff of
git clone https://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/mesa/glu.git
git reset --hard glu-9.0.0
and
ftp://ftp.freedesktop.org/pub/mesa/glu/glu-9.0.0.tar.bz2

Identical files aside.
There are 11 left-only/right-only files at root.
And the archive file is missing 2 documentation files in src\libtess: alg-outline and README.


1-2) Checking ReactOS included code against both Mesa/GLU upstream feeds:


1-2-1) Checking ReactOS included code against upstream archive file:

Different files aside.
There are 16 left-only/right-only files at root.
And the archive file is missing 2 documentation files in src\libtess: alg-outline and README.


1-2-2) Checking ReactOS included code against upstream Git:

Different files aside.
There are 7 left-only/right-only files at root.


1-3) Diff'ing ReactOS included code against upstream Git:

Upstream has LF end-of-lines, ReactOS has CRLF ones.

Left-only/right-only files at root aside.

133 files are different.
All have some #include commented out.

src\include\gluos.h has also
{{
+#define WIN32_NO_STATUS

+#include <string.h>
}}

src\libutil\mipmap.c has also
{{
-GLint GLAPIENTRY
+GLAPI GLint GLAPIENTRY
 gluScaleImage(...)
}}
