.SH "NAME"
lwres_getnameinfo \- lightweight resolver socket address structure to hostname and service name
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.nf
#include <lwres/netdb.h>
.fi
.HP 22
.BI "int lwres_getnameinfo(const\ struct\ sockaddr\ *" "sa" ", size_t\ " "salen" ", char\ *" "host" ", size_t\ " "hostlen" ", char\ *" "serv" ", size_t\ " "servlen" ", int\ " "flags" ");"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This function is equivalent to the
\fBgetnameinfo\fR(3)
function defined in RFC2133.
\fBlwres_getnameinfo()\fR
returns the hostname for the
\fBstruct sockaddr\fR
\fIsa\fR
which is
\fIsalen\fR
bytes long. The hostname is of length
\fIhostlen\fR
and is returned via
\fI*host.\fR
The maximum length of the hostname is 1025 bytes:
\fBNI_MAXHOST\fR.
.PP
The name of the service associated with the port number in
\fIsa\fR
is returned in
\fI*serv.\fR
It is
\fIservlen\fR
bytes long. The maximum length of the service name is
\fBNI_MAXSERV\fR
\- 32 bytes.
.PP
The
\fIflags\fR
argument sets the following bits:
.PP
\fBNI_NOFQDN\fR
.RS 4
A fully qualified domain name is not required for local hosts. The local part of the fully qualified domain name is returned instead.
.RE
.PP
\fBNI_NUMERICHOST\fR
.RS 4
Return the address in numeric form, as if calling inet_ntop(), instead of a host name.
.RE
.PP
\fBNI_NAMEREQD\fR
.RS 4
A name is required. If the hostname cannot be found in the DNS and this flag is set, a non\-zero error code is returned. If the hostname is not found and the flag is not set, the address is returned in numeric form.
.RE
.PP
\fBNI_NUMERICSERV\fR
.RS 4
The service name is returned as a digit string representing the port number.
.RE
.PP
\fBNI_DGRAM\fR
.RS 4
Specifies that the service being looked up is a datagram service, and causes getservbyport() to be called with a second argument of "udp" instead of its default of "tcp". This is required for the few ports (512\-514) that have different services for UDP and TCP.
.RE
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
\fBlwres_getnameinfo()\fR
returns 0 on success or a non\-zero error code if an error occurs.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBRFC2133\fR(),
\fBgetservbyport\fR(3),
\fBlwres\fR(3),
\fBlwres_getnameinfo\fR(3),
\fBlwres_getnamebyaddr\fR(3).
\fBlwres_net_ntop\fR(3).
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
RFC2133 fails to define what the nonzero return values of
\fBgetnameinfo\fR(3)
are.
