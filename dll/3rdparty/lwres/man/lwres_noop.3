.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
These are low\-level routines for creating and parsing lightweight resolver no\-op request and response messages.
.PP
The no\-op message is analogous to a
\fBping\fR
packet: a packet is sent to the resolver daemon and is simply echoed back. The opcode is intended to allow a client to determine if the server is operational or not.
.PP
There are four main functions for the no\-op opcode. One render function converts a no\-op request structure \(em
\fBlwres_nooprequest_t\fR
\(em to the lighweight resolver's canonical format. It is complemented by a parse function that converts a packet in this canonical format to a no\-op request structure. Another render function converts the no\-op response structure \(em
\fBlwres_noopresponse_t\fR
to the canonical format. This is complemented by a parse function which converts a packet in canonical format to a no\-op response structure.
.PP
These structures are defined in
\fIlwres/lwres.h\fR. They are shown below.

} lwres_noopresponse_t;
.fi
.RE

.PP
Although the structures have different types, they are identical. This is because the no\-op opcode simply echos whatever data was sent: the response is therefore identical to the request.
.PP
\fBlwres_nooprequest_render()\fR
uses resolver context
\fIctx\fR
to convert no\-op request structure
\fIreq\fR
to canonical format. The packet header structure
\fIpkt\fR
is initialised and transferred to buffer
\fIb\fR. The contents of
\fI*req\fR
are then appended to the buffer in canonical format.
\fBlwres_noopresponse_render()\fR
performs the same task, except it converts a no\-op response structure
\fBlwres_noopresponse_t\fR
to the lightweight resolver's canonical format.
.PP
\fBlwres_nooprequest_parse()\fR
uses context
\fIctx\fR
to convert the contents of packet
\fIpkt\fR
to a
\fBlwres_nooprequest_t\fR
structure. Buffer
\fIb\fR
provides space to be used for storing this structure. When the function succeeds, the resulting
\fBlwres_nooprequest_t\fR
is made available through
\fI*structp\fR.
\fBlwres_noopresponse_parse()\fR
offers the same semantics as
\fBlwres_nooprequest_parse()\fR
except it yields a
\fBlwres_noopresponse_t\fR
structure.
.PP
\fBlwres_noopresponse_free()\fR
and
\fBlwres_nooprequest_free()\fR
release the memory in resolver context
\fIctx\fR
that was allocated to the
\fBlwres_noopresponse_t\fR
or
\fBlwres_nooprequest_t\fR
structures referenced via
\fIstructp\fR.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.PP
The no\-op opcode functions
\fBlwres_nooprequest_render()\fR,
\fBlwres_noopresponse_render()\fR
\fBlwres_nooprequest_parse()\fR
and
\fBlwres_noopresponse_parse()\fR
all return
\fBLWRES_R_SUCCESS\fR
on success. They return
\fBLWRES_R_NOMEMORY\fR
if memory allocation fails.
\fBLWRES_R_UNEXPECTEDEND\fR
is returned if the available space in the buffer
\fIb\fR
is too small to accommodate the packet header or the
\fBlwres_nooprequest_t\fR
and
\fBlwres_noopresponse_t\fR
structures.
\fBlwres_nooprequest_parse()\fR
and
\fBlwres_noopresponse_parse()\fR
will return
\fBLWRES_R_UNEXPECTEDEND\fR
if the buffer is not empty after decoding the received packet. These functions will return
\fBLWRES_R_FAILURE\fR
if
\fBpktflags\fR
in the packet header structure
\fBlwres_lwpacket_t\fR
indicate that the packet is not a response to an earlier query.
