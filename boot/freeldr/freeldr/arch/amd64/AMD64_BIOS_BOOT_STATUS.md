# AMD64 BIOS Boot Status

## Current State (as of latest commits)

### What Works ✅
1. **Boot sector to FreeLdr transition**: Successfully transitions from 16-bit real mode through 32-bit protected mode to 64-bit long mode
2. **FreeLdr initialization**: All subsystems initialize correctly:
   - Memory manager
   - Filesystem layer  
   - Module list
   - Boot device detection
3. **Serial debug output**: Working throughout the boot process
4. **Boot path detection**: Correctly identifies CD-ROM boot (`multi(0)disk(0)cdrom(0)`)

### What Doesn't Work ❌
1. **Disk reading in long mode**: Cannot use BIOS INT 13h services in 64-bit mode
2. **Mode switching for Int386**: Attempting to switch from long mode to real mode causes system reboot
3. **Loading rosload.exe**: Cannot read from disk to load the second stage loader
4. **Booting the kernel**: Cannot proceed beyond FreeLdr without disk access

## Technical Limitations

### The Fundamental Problem
BIOS interrupt services (INT 13h for disk, INT 10h for video, etc.) are only available in:
- 16-bit real mode
- 16-bit protected mode (V86 mode)
- 32-bit protected mode (via V86 mode or mode switching)

They are **NOT** available in:
- 64-bit long mode

### Why Mode Switching Fails
The attempted implementation to switch from long mode to real mode involves:
1. Long mode → Compatibility mode (32-bit)
2. Compatibility mode → Protected mode 
3. Protected mode → Real mode
4. Call BIOS interrupt
5. Real mode → Protected mode
6. Protected mode → Compatibility mode
7. Compatibility mode → Long mode

This complex transition is failing at step 2-3, causing a system reboot.

## Possible Solutions

### 1. Pre-load in Real Mode (Not Implemented)
Load all necessary files (rosload.exe, kernel, drivers) in real mode before switching to long mode.
- **Pros**: Would work with existing BIOS
- **Cons**: Requires significant bootloader rewrite, memory management challenges

### 2. 32-bit FreeLdr for AMD64 (Not Implemented)
Keep FreeLdr in 32-bit mode even for AMD64 builds, only switch to 64-bit for kernel.
- **Pros**: Can use BIOS services via existing i386 code
- **Cons**: Requires architectural changes, may have compatibility issues

### 3. Use UEFI (Already Working) ✅
Boot via UEFI which provides native 64-bit runtime services.
- **Pros**: Already implemented and working
- **Cons**: Requires UEFI firmware (not available on older systems)

## Recommendation

For AMD64 systems, **use UEFI boot** which is already fully functional. BIOS boot on AMD64 should be considered a legacy/experimental feature with known limitations.

The current implementation successfully demonstrates that we can reach 64-bit long mode from BIOS and initialize FreeLdr, but cannot proceed further due to the fundamental incompatibility between BIOS services and 64-bit mode.

## Build Configuration

To experiment with BIOS disk reading (causes reboot):
```c
#define USE_INT386_DISK_READ
```

Current default: Disk reading disabled to maintain stability and show proper error messages.
