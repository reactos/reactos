 * FUNCTION:    AcpiDsBuildInternalPackageObj
 *
 * PARAMETERS:  WalkState       - Current walk state
 *              Op              - Parser object to be translated
 *              ElementCount    - Number of elements in the package - this is
 *                                the NumElements argument to Package()
 *              ObjDescPtr      - Where the ACPI internal object is returned
 *
 * RETURN:      Status
 *
 * DESCRIPTION: Translate a parser Op package object to the equivalent
 *              namespace object
 *
 * NOTE: The number of elements in the package will be always be the NumElements
 * count, regardless of the number of elements in the package list. If
 * NumElements is smaller, only that many package list elements are used.
 * if NumElements is larger, the Package object is padded out with
 * objects of type Uninitialized (as per ACPI spec.)
 *
 * Even though the ASL compilers do not allow NumElements to be smaller
 * than the Package list length (for the fixed length package opcode), some
 * BIOS code modifies the AML on the fly to adjust the NumElements, and
 * this code compensates for that. This also provides compatibility with
 * other AML interpreters.
