 *              Expand 32-bit addresses to 64-bit as necessary. Also validate
 *              important fields within the FADT.
 *
 * NOTE:        AcpiGbl_FADT must be of size (ACPI_TABLE_FADT), and must
 *              contain a copy of the actual BIOS-provided FADT.
 *
 * Notes on 64-bit register addresses:
 *
 * After this FADT conversion, later ACPICA code will only use the 64-bit "X"
 * fields of the FADT for all ACPI register addresses.
 *
 * The 64-bit X fields are optional extensions to the original 32-bit FADT
 * V1.0 fields. Even if they are present in the FADT, they are optional and
 * are unused if the BIOS sets them to zero. Therefore, we must copy/expand
 * 32-bit V1.0 fields to the 64-bit X fields if the 64-bit X field is originally
 * zero.
 *
 * For ACPI 1.0 FADTs (that contain no 64-bit addresses), all 32-bit address
 * fields are expanded to the corresponding 64-bit X fields in the internal
 * common FADT.
 *
 * For ACPI 2.0+ FADTs, all valid (non-zero) 32-bit address fields are expanded
 * to the corresponding 64-bit X fields, if the 64-bit field is originally
 * zero. Adhering to the ACPI specification, we completely ignore the 32-bit
 * field if the 64-bit field is valid, regardless of whether the host OS is
 * 32-bit or 64-bit.
 *
 * Possible additional checks:
 *  (AcpiGbl_FADT.Pm1EventLength >= 4)
 *  (AcpiGbl_FADT.Pm1ControlLength >= 2)
 *  (AcpiGbl_FADT.PmTimerLength >= 4)
 *  Gpe block lengths must be multiple of 2
