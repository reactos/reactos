 * Protected I/O ports. Some ports are always illegal, and some are
 * conditionally illegal. This table must remain ordered by port address.
 *
 * The table is used to implement the Microsoft port access rules that
 * first appeared in Windows XP. Some ports are always illegal, and some
 * ports are only illegal if the BIOS calls _OSI with a WinXP string or
 * later (meaning that the BIOS itelf is post-XP.)
 *
 * This provides ACPICA with the desired port protections and
 * Microsoft compatibility.
 *
 * Description of port entries:
 *  DMA:   DMA controller
 *  PIC0:  Programmable Interrupt Controller (8259A)
 *  PIT1:  System Timer 1
 *  PIT2:  System Timer 2 failsafe
 *  RTC:   Real-time clock
 *  CMOS:  Extended CMOS
 *  DMA1:  DMA 1 page registers
 *  DMA1L: DMA 1 Ch 0 low page
 *  DMA2:  DMA 2 page registers
 *  DMA2L: DMA 2 low page refresh
 *  ARBC:  Arbitration control
 *  SETUP: Reserved system board setup
 *  POS:   POS channel select
 *  PIC1:  Cascaded PIC
 *  IDMA:  ISA DMA
 *  ELCR:  PIC edge/level registers
 *  PCI:   PCI configuration space
