/*
 * Note: History of _PRW support in ACPICA
 *
 * Originally (2000 - 2010), the GPE initialization code performed a walk of
 * the entire namespace to execute the _PRW methods and detect all GPEs
 * capable of waking the system.
 *
 * As of 10/2010, the _PRW method execution has been removed since it is
 * actually unnecessary. The host OS must in fact execute all _PRW methods
 * in order to identify the device/power-resource dependencies. We now put
 * the onus on the host OS to identify the wake GPEs as part of this process
 * and to inform ACPICA of these GPEs via the AcpiSetupGpeForWake interface. This
 * not only reduces the complexity of the ACPICA initialization code, but in
 * some cases (on systems with very large namespaces) it should reduce the
 * kernel boot time as well.
