## Summary of AMD64 Build Warning Fixes

### Fixes Applied:

1. **Fixed dangling pointer in mesa/eval.c**
   - Moved local array 'col' outside conditional scope to fix dangling pointer issue

2. **Fixed array comparison in mesa/clip.c**
   - Changed macro to compare array addresses instead of arrays directly

3. **Fixed overlapping strcpy in freeldr/ui/ui.c**
   - Replaced strcpy with memmove for overlapping memory regions

4. **Fixed redundant NULL checks in shell32/CDirectoryWatcher.cpp**
   - Removed unnecessary 'this \!= NULL' checks

5. **Fixed free with offset pointer in network/ftp/cmds.c**
   - Saved original pointer for proper free() call

6. **Fixed local variable storage in cmd/for.c**
   - Allocated fc->values on heap instead of using local stack variable

7. **Fixed timer ListHead dangling pointer in ntoskrnl/ke/timerobj.c**
   - Properly initialized ListHead with timer entry to avoid dangling pointer

8. **Fixed function signature in dhcpcsvc/dhcp/adapter.c**
   - Changed array parameter to pointer in AdapterFindByHardwareAddress

9. **Fixed uninitialized variable in msctfime/profile.cpp**
   - Initialized m_dwFlags to 0 before using bitwise operations

10. **Fixed pointer-to-int cast in shell32/wine/shellpath.c**
    - Changed INT cast to INT_PTR for 64-bit compatibility

11. **Fixed misleading indentation in acpi/busmgr/utils.c**
    - Corrected indentation to use tabs consistently

12. **Fixed misleading indentation in uniata/id_init.cpp**
    - Made empty for loop body explicit with comment

These fixes address critical issues including:
- Memory safety (buffer overflows, dangling pointers)
- 64-bit compatibility (pointer casts)
- Code clarity (misleading indentation)
- Undefined behavior (uninitialized variables)
## Additional AMD64 Build Warning Fixes

### Latest Fixes Applied:

1. **Commented out unused variable in cmd/for.c**
   - Variables[32] array was declared but never used
   - Added TODO comment for future investigation

2. **Suppressed ACPICA unused function warnings in utils.c**
   - Added pragma to ignore unused inline functions from ACPICA headers
   - These are third-party headers that shouldn't be modified

3. **Documented virtual function hiding issue in cicuif.h**
   - CUIFWindow::OnTimer(WPARAM) hides CUIFObject::OnTimer()
   - Added TODO comment for future refactoring

### Notes:
- mkisofs truncation warnings are in host tools (not target code) - lower priority
- All critical runtime issues have been addressed
- Build completes successfully with remaining warnings being informational
